hxwpkM5w3Cc,I Got Hunted By The FBI,42724724,2005151,24646,"- I tied up an FBI agent.
(words pop)If he steals this hundred
thousand dollars from mebefore midnight, he keeps it.This is a knife.Good luck. Let's go, Tareq.- [The Boys] Oh, oh, what do we do?- [Tareq] Oh my gosh, we gotta go.- [Jimmy] Tareq, our first
stop's through the woods.- [Tareq] Jimmy, why are we
doing this again already?- Relax for one second.
I've been tied up before.- [Chris] He's getting
so much time ahead of us.- [Jimmy] We're coming out
the other side of the woods.Our getaway car is over here.- [Tareq] Whoa, that's a nice car, Jim.- [Jimmy] The car matches my bag.- [Tareq] We gotta go. We gotta go.- [Chris] How are you gonna catch himif your hands are tied?- And now we drive down this path.You guys have no idea what I
have in store for the boys.I rented an NFL football
stadium, an island, a maze,and tons of other cool things.And stop!- [Tareq] Oh! Why are we stopping already?- Just watch.You see this giant telephone pole?- [Tareq] Uh huh.- Watch this.- [Tareq] Oh, oh, oh my gosh-- Let's get back in the car.(car revving)- Buckle up.- Now there's a giant telephone
pole blocking the exit.- [The Boys] Oh.- Oh, here we go.- [The Boys] Hurry.- Grab on. Push it over.- Ohh!
- Push go.- [Karl] Guys, hurry up!- We put a GPS in my underwearso the FBI agent and the boys
will always know where I'm at.- [Nolan] Jimmy turned.- [Chris] Oh, wait, he turned?- [Nolan] He turned left.- If you zoom in-- It's a maze!- It's a maze!It gives us the layout of the maze.- We're now at the Hedge Mazeand I got the hundred thousand dollars.Look at how huge this maze is.We gotta be careful because
it'd be easy to get lostand for them to catch us in here.- [Jimmy] Uh, I think it's this way.- [Tareq] Okay...Uh, how do you know?- I've done this maze like 10 times,but the boys have never been here.- We're just gonna push him and push him,get him out of the area,and then as he's tiring,
we'll handle this.- I'm gonna leave them some money hereso they know they're going the right way.Or a random person's
just gonna find a grand.(Jimmy chuckles)- [The Boys] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!- [Nolan] It says open 11 to five.- [Kurt] See if we can
actually get right through it.- [Chris] Ooh.- [Kurt] Here we go.- [Jimmy] It was right,
right, left, right,left, right, right, left.Perfect. Okay.If you're in the cave,
you're in the right spot,which means if we go here,now we are officially in the watch tower.We can see the entire maze.- I'm gonna do a perimeter check.Make sure he is not outside.We gotta find the getaway car.- Hey Karl, come on.- There's that nerd.
- Hey, there he is!- Ooh!
- Okay!- [Jimmy] I bet you can't get me.- Ooh. The only exit is right here.- [Chris] Why is there money over here?- That was just to let you knowyou were going the right way.- [Chris] Jimmy, we're almost there.Just wait.- Oh, they are getting close.Shoot, okay. We gotta go, we gotta go.They're getting closer.I don't know how long I
planned on staying there.(Tareq laughs)- [Chris] He's older than us,but he's got so much more energy.Isn't this where Jimmy was?- [Kurt] Yes, it was.- I know you're looking at this, Jimmy.I'm taking your camera now.- The only exit outside
of this entire mazeis all the way up there,which is why yesterday
we put in a secret door.- [Tareq] Oh wow. Jimmy, this is crazy.Wait, Jimmy, is that our getaway car?- Notice how this says,
""Authorized Maze Personnel Only"".Now it says, ""Jimmy's Getaway Car"".- [Kurt] Hey guys, let's
go back to the car.The tracker's showing him up on the hill.- [Karl] All right. To the car!- [The Boys] Let's go!
- [Kurt] Let's go-- [Karl] Go, go, go, go, go.
- [Nolan] Get in.- I wonder if they've noticed
we're not in the maze anymore.- [Nolan] He's getting on the highway.- [Chris] Which way? Left or right?- Right.
- Right.- We can make all the
mistakes in the world-- Doesn't matter-- He's just gotta make one-- He gotta make one.- Yeah.- Yo, there were parts where
we were so close to themin the maze.That was terrifying.If they would've caught us there,this video would've been
only like two minutes.I made a mistake.Tareq's supposed to be
driving. Let's switch.- [Tareq] Let's switch.- Karl is the, is that money real?- Oh, it's real real.- Oh good.(boys laughing)- And the reason Tareq is driving,is because I need to put on a disguise.(soft, exciting music)I look so old.Now we put the hat on, throw
on a pair of glasses, and boom.I'm Boomer Jim.And we're heading to Walmartwhere I'm gonna try to
blend in with normal people.- Do you think he went to the mall to shopand we all go shopping?- We're pulling up to Walmart
and I'm gonna go insidewith the hundred thousand
dollars and the tracker.There's a pickax back here.And while they're inside searching for me,you need to pop all the tires
on their car to strand them.- Jimmy, I've never
popped a tire in my life.- Let's do this.- [Chris] Wait. It says
we're on top of him-- [The Boys] Hey!- [Kurt] Yeah. It says
we're right on top of him-- Take a, take a right down here-- [Karl] He's right here.- Don't let me down
with popping the tires.- [Tareq] I won't. God speed.- Park away from cars and
let's assess the situation.- And now I'm inside Walmart.And before I blend in, I
need to disguise this bag.Now I'm gonna take the hundred
thousand dollar backpackand put it in this bag.Now they'll never catch me.- You and I will go inside.You two stay, stay together.And let's see if we can search 'em out.Inside! Hold his hand, there ya go.- We're staying together.(phone ringing)- Are they here yet?- They're walking out right
now. They're going inside.- All right. They're going inside?- Yes, yes, yes.
(phone call ends)- The boys are about to
come inside. We gotta go.- [Tareq] They have no ideaI'm gonna smash all their tires.Look at 'em running.- [Chris] Looking for a six foot four guy,with a weird beard.- I can literally see the boyswalking down the gaming aisle.- I know that Jimmy told
me to pop all the tires,but I'm just gonna do one.Cuz I think I'm running low on time.FBI? More like, FB flat tire!(air hissing)(Tareq running)Oh, I gotta get the camera.- He's not walking around
anywhere. He's gotta be hiding.(phone ringing)- [Jimmy] Did you do the deed?- The deed is done.- They're so close to me.
I'm getting outta here.- [Tareq] Hurry up, grandpa.- I can't believe that worked.They were literally one
aisle beside me at one point.- What's the tracker say?- [Kurt] The tracker's
moving. The vehicle's moved.- Wait, it's moving?
- In the parking lot?- He's outta the...he's outta Walmart?- It feels amazing to have that mask off.We've knocked over a telephone pole,had a goose chase through a maze,and then hid in a Walmart as an old man.And the video's just getting started.I have so much more cool stuff planned.Like I'm literally heading to the airportto board a private jet right now.- Wait a second!
- What's that?Who popped our tires?
There's a pickax in our tire.- Well, if we don't have a
car, we're gonna change a flat.- [Nolan] Do you know
how to change a tire?- Of course I know how to change a tire.- [Chris] Remember you wanna go two or-(car falling)Yeah. That's why I don't like those jacks.- [Kurt] Yep.- Karl?- [Karl] Yeah?- Do you know where I
was hiding at Walmart?- No!- Basically I put on an old man suit,changed my clothes, and used a cane.Did you see a really old guy limping?- I don't pay attention to old people.- Well if you did see one
in Walmart, it was me.Good luck, nerd!(phone call ends)- Brah!(Chris groaning)- [Nolan] Chris, you working hard?- [Chris] You're hardly working.- We're getting close to the airport.I'm gonna call the private jet
and make sure they're ready.- It looks like he's on a taxiing runway.- He's gonna get in a plane and fly away.- This is why he slashed the tires.- And there's our private jet. Let's go.I'm getting on a private
jet with the dumbest outfitand a Cars backpack.What am I doing with my life?Come on. You're taking forever.I'm gonna try to time it where
the private jet takes offwhen they get here so they
can see me flying away.- What's up, Jimmy?- Hey buddy. How far away are you?- We're at the Walmart
man. Still fixing the tire.- Okay. Well-- Hey Jimmy, if you had to
pick a terminal to go into,would it be the passenger terminal?-- Oh, so that means you're here.Pilot, you can take off.- [Chris] Run, run, run.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.(upbeat music)- [Kurt] Last door.- Later, nerds.- That's him.That's him on that jet right there.- [Karl] Dude!- I have no idea how they're
gonna track where we're going.- We're gonna follow the airplane.Let's check inside where it's going.- Can we just do that?- Yes. Why not?- Oh. I guess he is FBI.- How you doing? FBI.Where did the airplane that
just left, where is it going?- Uh. Washington, D.C..(boys gasp)- [The Boys] What!
- Wonderful.- Is there another flight
to Washington, D.C.?- [Kurt] Anytime soon.- I don't see anything today. No.- Do we have to drive all
the way to Washington, D.C.?That's like-
- Hey, at least we got-- Three hours!- We gotta, we gotta new
tire for it. So we're good.- New tire. Let's go.- Private jet with stacks of money?For the first time ever, I
actually feel like a YouTuber.And now we're in Washington, D.C..We got about a three hour lead.And conveniently our driver is Nick.You might remember him from this video.He's so much nicer when
he's not chasing me.- Ha ha! You ready to get outta here?- Let's go.- Let's go.- Guys! He just landed in D.C..- [Chris] What?- [Karl] Actually?- [Nolan] Yeah.- That's over two hours away now still.- Are we finally in Washington, D.C.?- Holy cow-
- What does it say-- Wait, Washington the state?Cuz that would suck.- And now we're at our
next location; the U-Store.So like we talked about on the phone,distract the boys, okay?- Okay.- He's right beside Costa Rica trading.Whatever that is, it's right beside it.- I just bought this storage lockerand I'm gonna put this sign
right here with this message:""Time is running out. I was in the box.""If that doesn't make any sense,
just gimme a few seconds.- Maybe we can approach from the back.- Hey, I tried that
with your mom one time.(boys laughing)- Me and you are gonna
hide in these boxes.We're literally about
to get shipped alive.- Jimmy, what is this?What do you have me doing bro?- Oh, that was probably
the worst drive ever.- Ahhh!- Karl. You stay here
and watch the vehicle.Make sure no one pops our tire again.- I'll sit right here.- [The Boys] You're standing.- I'm wondering if you've
seen this individual.- Oh yeah, I saw him.- Still around here?- Yeah. I think he's downstairs.Let me take you there.- Downstairs!
- Downstairs?- Downstairs?- Should we just be
following random peopleto their basement?Is this okay?I just don't understand why
all this is necessary, Jimmy.- Let me get something to cut it.Can you wait for me here, sir?- Yeah.- That truck you see
right here is my getaway.I'm being transported right now.Karl was right above us.- Holy crap.(blade cutting)- [The Boys] This is so extra!Hey, here we go.- [Chris] ""Time is
running out. Karl sucks.I was in the box.""- Hey, hey. Check the tracker right now.- [Chris] We're gonna have to go upstairsto get service, to check.- Are we free to get out?- [Tareq] Um. Hold on. Not yet.- I got Jimmy right here. He's gone.He's long gone-- Here's the thing.There was a box truck when we got here.He's gone in the box truck!- [Karl] Guys! Where have you been?- Come on. We just gotta go.- I can't believe that worked.Up next, we're going to a private island.- Jimmy looks like he's crossed a bridgeand now going to a boathouse.- Oh my goodness.So we got a plane, a boat, a box truck.What else is he gonna do?- Thanks for the trip. Have a good day.Even though that was really cool.The box truck moves incredibly slow,so they could be here any second.What's up, man?You ready to take us to the island?Let's do this.- Jimmy's calling. What's up, Jimmy?- [Jimmy] Okay. What up, Chris?Hey, how's it going?You getting in a boat?- No, actually I'm not.- That's a nice pier you're at.- Wait. Where are you?- Maybe we might be about to
tackle you in about 10 seconds-- Maybe I'm under-
- I hung up.Look now we're turning the tables.He thinks we're right
by him and we're not!- Wait. I was calling him
to brag about the boxes,but now I'm confused.- [Karl] There are so many
boats here. What is going on?- All right. There he is go, go, go, go.- [Tareq] That's Karl. That's Karl.- You nerd!- [Tareq] They're coming!
- [Jimmy] Go, go, go.- [Tareq] They're coming in strong.- I got you some swan boats.- It's always boats with you.- Hey, get to pedaling
on your little swan.- We'll go after him-- Go.
- Go!- We'll get in the next one.- I'm gonna be honest.I never tested those swans.For all I know, they could be really fast.- Wow. This is slow.This is unreasonably slow.- Did you ever chase
anyone on a swan before?- This will be a first.`- I'm gonna act like the boat broke.Hey, Karl!- Yes?- My boat isn't working.So I'd hurry up.- His boat's broken.Here's our chance. Hurry!(boys grunting)- This is the most
anti-climatic thing ever.- [Tareq] Yeah.- You got four hours left
until I keep the hundred grand.See you later.- You'll pay!- And now we're at the island.Hurry up, nerds!- Come on over, let's talk.The sun's not even down yet, my friend.- They just docked.- [Tareq] Go, go, go, go. They're close!- [Chris] Hey, come on, guys.- [Kurt] You're going right in.You're fine.- What the heck are we doing?- I think we're lost.
We went the wrong way.Oh where do we go? Please help us.Help us. Help us.We asked some people
on the island for help.Cause to be honest, I'm lost.- [Tareq] Me too.- Jimmy, I will end you!We're stuck. We're lost.(indistinct)Now we found a path. This has
to be where Jimmy's going.- I only have three more hours here.We need to get going here.He's on the other side of the island.- We make it outta here
without getting found,then we're finally going
to the NFL stadium.Are you subscribed?- Uh yeah.- [Tareq] Jimmy we don't have time.- We always have time for this.- [Tareq] That's fair.- I don't care to fact check
you. Here's some money.- Uh what?- Thanks for subscribing. Now
I gotta run to regain my time.- [Tareq] Yes!- Guys?What!Kurt. There's nothing.- We made it off the island
to our getaway vehicle.And now it's time for my
favorite part of the video.We're heading to an NFL
stadium that I rented.- We should have never got on this island.- Let's see where he is now.- [The Boys] Oh, he's still driving?- He's going towards Capitol Hill.- I can't believe we rented
an entire NFL stadium.Look at how huge this place is!This is gonna be so much fun.- [Karl] Let's get to our car. Come on.We have like two hours left.- I hate to break the bad news to you,but it ain't a spa.- What is it?- A football stadium.- He's at a football stadium?- That sounds like running...- I have a pre-recorded
video of me on looptelling them they'll never find me.""You'll never find me in this stadium.Losers.""Isn't that so funny?And not only do I have
that video playing on loop,but I've filled the
stadium with mannequinsso they'll think it's me.They literally only have
two and a half hours leftto get this money.- Let's go, go, go, go, go.- Did he just rent an entire stadium?Unbelievable. Let's see where he is.So we have, he looks
like he's in the center.- Wait, Jimmy's on the TV!- [Chris] Aw.- [Kurt] Oh no.- [Chris] Come on.- All right, I think
that's a little too much.- Oh, he tortured me for a whole day here.- Let's go get him.- Let's go get him.
- Can we go catch him?- Let's go get him.- [Jimmy] ""You'll never
find me in this stadium-- Holy cow.- ""You'll never find me-
- [Kurt] Oh my Lord.- [Nolan] Look at all the mannequins!- As you can see, the boys
just walked into the stadium.They're probably so confused.Can you cut the audio for me please?""You'll never find me in this stadium.""Wait for it...Boom. Now the audio's off. It's my time.- How did this man-
- [Jimmy] Hello, boys.- Hello?- Hello?- As you can see, there
is over 70,000 seatsand unlimited rooms in this stadium.I need you guys to expect the unexpected.Cuz, I could literally be anywhere.And don't forget; you literally
only have two hours leftto win this hundred thousand dollars.Good luck!- This place is huge!- What a jerk-- Oh also, Karl's a nerd.- [Karl] Stop man! What the heck!(Jimmy laughing)- Yo, this is so much fun.- Hey, hey! I saw movement in that window-- [Chris] He has to be in a box
where he can reach this mic-- I swear I just saw movement.- Nolan, what are you pointing at?- I saw you! I saw movement!- Wait, where is he pointing?Turn to your left a little bit.- I see him!Run!- [Chris] I told you he was in a box.- And now they're coming
straight towards us.- [Tareq] Why'd you do this?- We should probably move.- [Tareq] We should go.(Tareq and Jimmy laughing)- [Chris] He's on the run!- And now we're heading out the back way.And the cool part is, they
don't know what the back way is.Good luck, nerds. I believe in you.- Hey guys, over here!- He just called the boys!Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.- Second level. He is moving around.- [Nolan] Kurt!- He's going that way.- [Nolan] How do we get up there?- This way! Escalators.- [Jimmy] Let's go up.- [Tareq] Let's just go up?- [Nolan] Oh no! They're not working!(intense music)That's Jimmy!- [Jimmy] It's Nolan!- Hurry, it's Jimmy!- Tareq! Sacrifice yourself!- [Tareq] Sacrifice myself?- Yeah.- [Tareq] He went that way.- [Nolan] No, he didn't, there's a door!Get out of the way, Tareq!Where'd he go? Where'd he go?- Here's my strategy.I'm gonna go fake pose like a mannequinand pray they don't find me
for the next hour and a half.Okay?They've seen what I'm wearing.So I'm gonna steal this
mannequins clothes.Do I look like a mannequin?- Jimmy, come on out and play.- I know he's one of the
mannequins over there.Let's pretend like we don't know that.These stupid mannequins, man.Where is this nerd?- [Chris] If I was Jimmy,
where would I hide?- [Nolan] Kurt? Kurt.- [Tareq] Jimmy, go, go, go, go.- [The Boys] Yes! Let's go!- Honestly, I've been
running for like 14 hours.When he was right there, I was like,I don't feel like getting tackled.He can just have the money.What are you gonna spend
the hundred grand on?- I'm gonna spend it on my wife.- Really?- I'm gonna make sure that
my family is enjoys it.- Aw-- that's the important thing-- That's really sweet.- One of the best
experiences I've ever had.- In our last video, I mentioned
that every single personthat buys this executive
producer shirt or hoodiewill get their name at
the end of this video,which is why you see names on
the left side of your screen.Because that is every single personthat purchased this shirt or hoodie.And I didn't tell you
guys I would do this,but on top of that,we also wrote every
single one of your nameson the wall of my studio.Literally every day,
when I come in to film,I'm gonna see your name on this wall.Like Peter Wild, when I film,
I'm gonna be reminded of you.And same with Knox and
Knox Tucker and Kodaand Koda G and all these Michaels.And on top of that,
Chandler, bring it on in.I also got all your
names put on this Tesla.That's right. Not only are all
your names on my studio wall,but your names are also on this Tesla.And this is the fun part.Chandler, I want you to pick
a random name on this Teslaand we're gonna give it to
them in like 30 seconds.All right, let's do it.Matt Liggett.- [Jimmy] What about him?- [Chandler] He didn't win.- [Jimmy] Oh, he didn't win?Well, tell me when you have the winner.- Hey Jimmy, you have
Peyton Chicken Nuggetas one of your fans.- Can you investigate that?
See if that's their real name.- I'm thinking probably not.- Derpyfish, 89.I told you to use your real name,but I didn't actually fact check it.You go in the S category.There's a bunch of Sponge Bobs.And I know your names aren't SpongeBob.- Jimmy!- Yeah?- Tell me when to stop.- Uh, wait for it, now stop.- Oh. Which finger?- I'm a pinky kinda guy.- Alexander Hedge, this Tesla...- [The Boys] Yeah! All right-- I don't know if that made any sense.Congratulations, Alexander.
You just won a brand new Tesla.Sorry that it's covered in names.If you want, you can remove 'em.Thank you so much.Subscribe.

9NQQKNAwaPk,10 Mythical CREATURES That Actually Existed,2089601,46750,1954,"I used to taste your daddy who doesn'tlove a good story especially ones whichinvolve unbelievable mythologicalcreatures that you wouldn't remotelythink are real but as history has proventhere is a basis for which thesecreatures were brought up today we'regoing to be looking at ten mythicalcreatures that actually existed numberone itself will make you questionwhether middle-earth was real or not sostay tuned for that one with all thatsaid and done let's begin shall wenumber ten the direwolfit's a freak it's a direwolfdirewolves became lively popular whenGame of Thrones hit the mainstream theselarge wolves are a constant companion ofthe starts in the show and are shown tobe large intelligent and protective theyare not however just merely a figment ofGeorge RR Martin's imagination they arein fact based on real animalsdire wolves live during the Pleistocenebetween 250,000 to roughly 10,000 yearsagounfortunately real dire wolves were notreally the size of ponies they werelarger than modern wolves though andcould weigh as much as 200 pounds almosttwice with a very large modern wolfmight weigh their skulls are much largercompared to today's modern wolvesironically though their brains are muchsmaller however if they had biggerbrains we probably wouldn't have hadamazing fossils of them thousands ofdire wolf fossils have been found in theLa Brea Tar Pitsscientists believe that they weretrapped there when they started feedingon the carcasses of other animalstrapped in the tarnumber nine the unicorn perhaps theearliest account of unicorns is by wellknown Greek historian Satish yes wedescribed a large animal with a horn onits forehead in India it's quitepossible that he saw a rhino from adistance and thought it was a horse witha horn on its head but fossils unearthedin Siberia may have proven the existenceof this mythical creature called theSiberian unicorn it was 1.8 metres tallover four metres long and weighed morethan four tons it was covered in ashaggy coat and earned his nickname fromthe huge horn that grew out of itsforehead yes it doesn't exactly resemblethe classic unicorn of lore but so farthis is the closer that we can get to areal one they were believed to have diedout three hundred and fifty thousandyears ago but the discovery of a fossilin Kazakhstan changed all that carbondating tests revealed the fossil to beonly 29 thousand years oldthis means that the animal roamed theearth 300 of 21,000 years longer thanpreviously thoughtnumber 8 the Komodo dragon[Music]believe it or not the Komodo dragon wasconsidered a mythical creature all theway up to 1910 when it was firstdiscovered prior to that rumors werespreading the eight foot long hundredpound prehistoric lizards were living ona remote Indonesian island wanting toprove or disprove the existence of thesecreatures himself dutch colonial officerlieutenant stein van hands broke puttogether an expedition to komodo islandhe was able to catch and kill a six-footspecimen and he sent the carcass asproved to the zoological museum andbotanical garden at Bogor java seeminglynot satisfied with the discoveryamerican explorer w douglas Burdondecided to put together an expeditionhimself making up his mind to catch livespecimens in the end the expedition wasable to pile several dead and to liveKomodo dragons on to their steamer andthen returned to New York City givingscientists plenty to study and visitorsof the Bronx Zoo plenty to see numberseven the Bunyip the Bunyip is a littlelike australia's Loch Ness monster andthat it lives in the water and has neverbeen photographed despite the fact thathundreds of people have seen ithowever the legend might have had actualrational origins the bunyip is anAboriginal legend according toAustralian history the name means adevil or spirit and the creature is saidto look like a cross between a crocodileand a horse the granted though accountsdo differ bunyips stock and kill humanbeings and supposedly make an eeriesound like a hollow boom which certainlyseems terrifying if you've never beenaround any shotguns or farm equipmentmost scientists believe that the Bunyipwas derived from an extinct rhino sizedmarsupial called the dipper Adhanremains of this animal were first foundin the region of 1839 it's unlikely thatthere are any surviving populations ofDipper Don in Australia but they onlydine about 20,000 to 40,000 years agothis was long after the arrival of theAboriginal people this suggests thelegends might have come from real-lifeencounters between humans and thesecreatures number sixthe gorilla it's hard to imagine a worldwithout gorillas at least based ontoday's standardsback then tales of large hairy savageman beasts with bad tempers living inthe wilds of some faraway place seemstoo good to be truetheir legend persevered until 1847 whenphysician and naturalist Thomas savagemanaged to obtain gorilla bonesincluding a skull in Liberia prior tothe first discovery of the bones thefirst recorded sighting of a gorilla wasmade by the Explorer hanno in the 5thcentury BC another Explorer named AndrewPatel also told tales of human-likemonsters visiting his campfire everymorning after the humans had left forthe day but he also noted that thesemonsters weren't intelligent enough toput more wood on the campfire so hiscredibility quickly went up in flameslive gorillas went left unseen anduntouched for a decade after savagesdiscovery until Explorer Paul du challuhunted like gorillas and sent specimensback to the many societies who werefunding his expeditions the subspeciesmountain gorillas unbelievably remaineda mythological creature for more thanhalf a century more only beingdiscovered in 1902 by German CaptainRobert von borangenumber 5 the basilisksallie paid the basilisk is a mythicalcreature born from a toader serpent'segg incubated under a cockerel theterrible offspring that hatches fromthis egg is a half bird half snake andall evil it is one of the deadliestcreatures to Menace the mythologicalworld and it's extremely hostile towardshumans you might be familiar with thismonster from the Harry Potter book andmovie the Chamber of Secrets but themonster shown there is somewhatincomplete and only appears as a giantserpent the basilisk is sometimesdescribed as a giant snake without thecockerels head or wings still itsmovement is unlike other snakesrather than slithering with its stomachon the ground it curls forward with thefront half of its body towering abovethe earth the monster's most famousweapon has its dreaded gaze the potencyof its gaze is discussed in all themyths that relate to them across severaldifferent cultures sometimes they arealso known to breathe out fire does thedescription vaguely remind you ofsomething many experts believe that thebasilisk is none other than a cobra fromits size of the way it stands erect whenpreparing to strike even the Cobras hoodcould be mistaken for wings and thefire-breathing part well we all knowthat certain species of covers have tospit out venom and this venom does causea burning sensation so there we go thebasilisk may be a misunderstood Cobra ormaybe it's another undiscovered creaturewho knows number four the duck-billedplatypus can you imagine the rest of theworld thinking that you're a hoax butyou know for a fact that you're ahundred percent real if you don'tconsider yourself lucky the duck-billedplatypus however had to spend most ofits existence mythological hearsay orworse a complete fabrication firstdiscovered in the 18th century wasconsidered by many to be a ridiculoushoax and not without reason this was anage when naturalist were creating allsorts of strange creatures with the helpof taxidermy and creative imaginationit was first described by Englishzoologist George Shaw who wrote that itresembled and I quote the beak of a duckengrafted on the head of a quadrupedhead all the fakery is signed theplatypus is remarkable for many reasonsnot just its peculiar appearancenaturalist could not determine whetherthe creature was a mammal did it layeggs or give birth to live babies ittook another 100 years for scientists todiscover the answer to that as it turnedout the platypus is one of the very fewmammal species to lay eggs and is alsopoisonous fun number three the Cyclops[Music]in Greek mythology the Cyclops weregiant creatures that were unmistakablein their appearance sporting a singleeye in the center of each of their headsthey were also known for their barbarityafraid of neither men nor gods the mostfamous Cyclops was Polyphemus whichattacked Odysseus in a cave and ate halfof his menOdysseus blinded the Cyclops eye runninga wooden stake through his single eyevan Odysseus and his men escaped bytying themselves to the undersides ofsheep this sounds very implausiblethough pertaining to sheep strong enoughto carry the weight of a full-grown manbut the existence of Cyclops there mightbe some truth to that actually for manyyears there appeared to be solid proofthat these one-eyed monsters reallyexisted quite a few huge skulls werefound which appeared to have a singleeye socket in the middle of theirforehead it turns out that the skullsbelong to dwarf elephants the eye socketwas the central nasal cavity and theopening for the elephant's trunk manydwarf elephants have been found inCyprus especially in case where theCyclops were supposed to have livedtherefore it's perhaps natural that anelephant skull would have been taken asevidence of a race of giant man-eatingcreatures with one eye and terribletable manners now it's time for theday's best Pigtoday we're gonna be taking a look atthe creature who is the poster child formythical creatures that turned out to bereal find out what comes up next withnumber two the Kraken releaseoriginating in Nordic folklore theKraken was said to be a powerful seamonster strong enough to drag an entireship to the depths by wrapping intogigantic tentacles around the vessel orby swimming in circles around it tocreate a whirlpool that would drag theship down it was first written about inan 1180 and there were many accounts ofa gigantic tentacled sea monsterdragging their ships to their doom theKraken was said to be able to devour anentire ship's crew in a single mouthfulthe myths of the Kraken is likely tohave arisen after sightings of a speciesof the giant squid also known by itsscientific name the ARCIC youthis duckswhich can grow to around 59 feet long orpossibly the colossal squid known by itsscientific name is meso kina ThetisHamel Tony which is significantly largerthan the giant squid it can grow tounknown lengths very few

Y_PQrPRolvM,Real Giants Caught On Camera!,518170,4033,271,"Hi!
Who said that giants are imaginary and onlyexist in fairy tales? There are many big people
out in the world. Whoever is taller than 7feet is considered to be a giant. It isn t
very good to be tall. Large size can be areal problem for a person. It can affect your
health and really decrease your life quality.Today we will show you some people that look
very different from regular folk. We re talkingabout real life giants.
. This is Robert Bobroczky from Romania. Hisenormous height is a combination of genetics
and a type of gigantism. His father was 7ft 2 in tall and his mom 6 ft 2 in. WhenRobertwasonly14hemovedtoItaly
where he became a part of a basketball team.Those people took care of his diet. Back then
Robert used to weight 182pounds and it feltlike he could brake just by making any kind
of clumsy movement. And it still feels thisway now. His movements look kind of unnatural.
Robert used to eat 7 times a day, gainingweight by all possible means. Then video of
him playing appeared online. He got askedto play in US. Right now he lives in Texas
and dreams to become a professional basketballplayer. He is 7 ft 8 in high and weights 225
ponds. CoachessaythatBobroczky knows how tothrow a ball and he is a good player overall
and most importantly, he s a hardworking guy.Anyways, every time he gains speed on the
way to the hoop, it looks kind of strange.This is the problem that trainers are trying
to fix right now. They came up with a schedulefor him, which includes not only his training
sessions but also different kinds of exercisesfor his body muscles. They try to do it all
gradually so that they don t damage his body.Let s wish this guy luck and hope that he
ll achieve all the things he wishes to achieve.. Gogea Mitu
You re looking at the tallest boxer in history.Even famous Nikolay Valuev looks like a little
boy standing next to him. Unfortunately nobodyknows the real name of the giant. But there
are two versions however.Gogu Stefanescu andDumitru Guaga. This guy was also known as
Romanian Goliath. Still, most people callhim GogeaMitu. He was born on September 1909
in Romania. When he was three years old, Mituwas taller than nine year old boys. And by
the age of ten he was taller than almost anygrown up man.
At the age of 20 he started boxing. But itwas very hard to find a proper opponent for
him. Everyone was too scared to fight him.His first fight happened at the Venus stadium
in Bucharest. He fought against professionalItalian boxer SaverioGrizzo. That time he
knocked out his opponent in the first round.His second fight was against the Romanian
champion DumitruPavelescu. That time he alsowon with a knockout in the first round. According
to various sources his height was 7 ft 9 into 8 ft 2 in.
.Igor VovkovinskiyNext on our list is IgorVovkovinskiy from
Ukraine. He lives in US now where he alreadyhad 16 surgeries. Those made him stop growing
and now he is 7 ft. 9 in. He grows up so fastbecause hispituitary gland produce too much
growth hormone. Ever since he was little,it was evident that he looks nothing like
other kids. In the 90s when Igor was onlysix years old, he was already about 6 feet
tall.His family had to re-plan the house because
of his height. Their house was much biggerthan most houses. All because of the boys
height. Everything is big shower, kitchen,dressing room everything. And even though
life is hard for both Igor and his mom, theystill find time and money to help those in
need.. Yao Defen from China was considered to be
the tallest woman in the world. When she wasborn she was much larger than her peers. She
was born in 1972 in Anhui. Although by theage of 11 she was already over 5 feet high.
All of her family members are not very tall.The reason for the way she is is the pituitary
tumor. She stopped growing after she had asurgery. She is now 7 ft 7 in tall and weights
390 pounds.She makes her living working in a circus.
And her master didn t let her see a doctorwhen she had severe pains. One time during
a performance she received a few injuriesbut she was forced to work nevertheless and
sometimes they even would not let her eat.Fortunately, Yao was able to escape that horrible
slavery. She died in 2012 at a hospital afterdamaging her head.
. When Ukrainian Leonid Stadnik was a teenagerhe had a brain surgery. After that surgery
he started growing really fast. Soon pituitarytumor formed in his brain, that s what made
him so big. Leoniddidn t feel too well. Hecouldn teve walk properly. For a long time
he refused to get in the book of records.But then he totally signed his name in the
book in 2007. He beat the previous recordholder BaoXishun. His height was 8 ft 5 in
and he weighted 440 pounds.In august 2008BaoXishun signed right back
after Stadnik refused to get measured by theofficials. He said he didn t want any fame
and he didn t want people to talk about him.For the past 10 years he s been gaining about
an inch every month. And I guess we can concludethat by the end of his life he was really
tall. Leonid died on august 24 in 2014. Causeof death - hormone-producing tumor hemorrhage.
.Sultan Kosen.Turkish Sultan Kosenhas been considered the
tallest man in the world for a long time andnow it seems like he actually stopped growing.
He is 8ft 2 inches high. He starter growingrapidly at 10 years of age. His body was producing
way too much growth hormone. Over the courseof two decades he grew by 8 feet. He was under
threat of dying because his brain was takingup too much pressure.
In 2008Kosen had his first surgery. That swhen they removed his tumor. But that didn
t stop his growth. Only in 2010 in Virginiauniversity they tried a new method on him,
which showed some good results. Seems likeSultan officially stopped growingnow. Butlifeisn
teasyforhim. He sveryuncomfortableinsidebuildings.Andhecanbarley getinsideacar. And he simply
can t find any proper clothes in regular clothingstores. There are no 5 feet long trousers
in regular shops.But there are some obvious positives in Kosen
s life. He enjoys listening to music and helikes watching good movies. He plays video
games and he chats to his Instagram followers.He posts pictures of himself sharing some
relevant news about his life. Sultan sayshe enjoys observing people from the height
of his height and that changing laps is nevera problem for him.
.Robert Pershing WadlowAnd the tallest human in all the history is
of course Robert Wadlow. On February 22 in1918Addie May Wadlow gave birth to a healthy
child and called him Robert. Robert weightedonly 8 pounds. And he was a pretty ordinary
child but the thing about him was that hegrew a lot faster than other kids. At his
first birthday his weight was 44 pounds andhe was 3 ft 4 inches tall. At the age of 8
he was already taller than his 6 feet talldad. At thirteen he became the tallest boy
scout and by the time he finished high schoolhe was 8 ft. 4 in tall.
He was diagnosed with pituitary hyperplasia,which is something that s characterized by
abnormally high levels of growth hormone.His gigantic proportions was a huge problem.
His energy demand was something like 8000calories, which is 3 times more than a regular
man needs on average. He experienced problemswith blood circulation and he walked with
a cane most of the time. Americans alwaysloved him and they were always proud of him.
Wadlow died in his sleep at the age of 22.Last time Robert s height was measured it
was 8 ft 11 in and weighted 439 pounds. Over40 000 people came to say their goodbyes to
the tallest man on the planet. All the shopsin town were closed on that day. His coffin
weighted about 1000 pounds. It took 12 peopleto carry it. There is a real size statue of
RobertPershingWadlow in his native town ofAlton in Illinois. Also there are a few wax
figures of this remarkably tall men in Ripley'smuseums.
.Emmanuel YarbroughThe next giant man on the list is the heaviest
athlete in history. It sEmmanuel Yarbrough.He s a sumo wrestler and mma fighter. His
size isn t exactly typical for an mma fighter.He used to fight his opponents when he weighted
650 pounds, being 6 feet 7 in tall. But hewould often loose as his opponents would normally
make him all weary and then beat the hellout of him. Perhaps the most fun fight was
when he went up against DaijuTakase who weighted167 pounds. Yarbroughdidn t even need to do
anything. He just had to lay down on his opponent.But the Japanese was very nimble and Yarbrough
could hardly lay his hands on him..Choi Hong-man
Last man on our list is Hong Man Choi. AnotherMMA fighter. He s from south Korea, he is
7 ft 2 in high and weights 352 pounds. Heonce fought against FedorEmelianenko. Back
thenFedor won the fight but at some pointthroughout the fight it seemed like Fedor
was done for good when the giant was lyingon top of him.

ZZtYAOpHVYk,10 Real Life GIANTS,9244943,64025,6508,[Music]hey guys what's up it's charlie here andtoday we're going to be looking at 10giants that exist in real life thesepeople are either really huge in termsof their height or in terms of theirmuscles but seriously though some ofthese people legitimately lookphotoshopped but i can guarantee thatthese people are a hundred percent realso please drop a like if you enjoy let'saim for four thousand likes on thisvideo because it really does help me outso coming in at number ten we have sajadgaribbi so this guy is from iran and hegot really famous on instagram and hehas over 200 000 followers he'snicknamed the iranian giant because ofhis insane build he's only 24 and heweighs 24 stone and 90 percent of thatis pure muscle i don't even know ifthat's good for you but seriously thisguy is thick afi'm joking guys but this guy is weirdlybig and to show you how big he actuallyis he usually poses with small objectsto show how huge he is in comparison tothem it's called overcompensating butanyway this guy is really strong and hecan lift over 400 pounds and that'sactually won a lot of competitions inweightlifting for iran and if you guysdidn't already think that sajad was abit of a badass then you should knowthat in 2016 he went off to syria tofight isis i mean if i was an isis and isee this guy running towards me i'dprobably have to change all of mybeliefs right there on the spot [ __ ]being squashed to death by this guy imean i'm no expert but it looks likethis guy's muscles could stop a bullet[ __ ] maybe even a nuclear missile but inall seriousness this guy is absolutelyhuge and i have no idea why he wasn'tpicked to play the incredible hulk canyou guys spot the difference anywayhere's a video clip of him showing hismusclesso coming up next is andre the giant nowthis one is a little old but he'sprobably the most famous giant of alltime so i had to include him on thislist so this guy is from france and hewas one of the most famous wrestlers inthe world and he was also an actor in aton of movies the reason this guy is sobig is because he's been diagnosed withgiantism because of his excess hormoneslike look at these people they're notsmall people they're totally normalsized it's just he's absolutely massiveand here's a crazy photo i found of hishand holding a beard this guy couldliterally squash your whole head withhis hand to be honest i think it's agood thing that even though he basicallyhas a disability he overcame it and hebasically got super famous for it andwho knows maybe he even inspired othergiants to use his size to theiradvantage sadly he did die of a heartfailure in 1993 which was probablylinked to wrestling to be honest andwhat's really sad about that is he wasonly 46. anyway here's a few clips ofhim fighting in the wwe so you can seehow insanely big this guy isso next up is brahim takalua so this isanother guy he's been diagnosed withgiantism and his massive size is crazyenough anyway but what's reallyinteresting about brahim is that he hasa specific world record and that'shaving the world's biggest feat his feetare one foot and three inches long whichis taller than the world's shortestwoman this guy's from morocco and usedto get bullied all of the time for hisbig feet and his massive height but nowhe's a celebrity and a big actor andhe's even been in a few bollywood moviesand you guys know how i mentioned theworld's smallest woman earlier yeah he'sactually really good friends with hereven though they're so different i guessopposites do attract anyway here's alittle bit of video of brahim so you cansee how giant he really isso next upguy is really special because he'scurrently the tallest person alive rightnow he's 251 centimeters tall or eightfeet and three inches depending on whatsystem you use anyway the reason he's sobig is because of a tumor that basicallymessed up his hormones and his job's notas interesting as the movie stars theisis killers and the wrestlers this guyis actually a farmer in turkey where hewas born and the reason he went intothat kind of work is because of how bighe is he can carry loads of heavy stuffand also because he was so tall hecouldn't fit into a school so wecouldn't get an education that's kind of[ __ ] up i mean it's not like he canhelp it and i know this guy is prettymassive but the school must have beenpretty small if it wasn't even eightfeet and three inches tall i don't knowwhy this guy didn't try and become aprofessional basketball player i mean idefinitely would but i guess it's up tohim anyway here's a few video clips ofsultan[Applause]and coming up next is romario dos santosalves now when i tell you this guy'sbackstory you may think he's kind ofstupid and to be honest i totally agreeunlike the other giants on this list whodidn't choose to be giants well this guykinda did he basically injected a fluidinto his arms to make them absolutelyhuge but i want to do this at home whatwere the ingredients well it's a veryscientific and biological fluid and theingredients are oil and alcohol yeahthis guy may as well have just gone intomcdonald's and then just injected theiroil straight into his arms anyway thereason the guy did this is because hewanted to be the world's biggestbodybuilder well he might be the mostcircular bodybuilder but he's definitelynot the biggest and if you're wonderingwhy i call this guy an idiot it'sbecause he almost died injecting that[ __ ] into his arms and it's not like hedidn't know he could die from it becausea few of his friends have done the samething and they died and he's actuallybadly bullied by all of the kids in thisneighborhood in brazil who call him abeast and a monster i mean i wouldn't gothat far but this guy definitely doesn'tlook normal here's a before and afterphoto of him showing what alcohol andoil did to him welcome to the 21stcentury guys so next up is half forjulius bjornsson now this guy is superfamous and if you've ever watched gameof thrones you'll probably know who thisguy is this guy from iceland is aprofessional strong man basketballplayer and actor wow this guy has a lotof talents and this guy's nickname isthe mountain not just because he's fromiceland but also because he's a giant heweighs almost 450 pounds and is almost 7feet tall and what's really weird aboutthis guy is even though he was tall whenhe was younger he wasn't that big here'sa photo of him when he was youngerplaying basketball and you guys alreadyknow how he looks now so yeah this isone insane transformation here's a photoof him and his wife i mean damn even hisshopping bag looks almost as big as herhere's a few clips of him so you can seehow strong this guy really is[Applause][Music]so coming up next is dennis cyplenkov sothis guy from ukraine is another giantwho holds a specific world record he hasthe world's biggest hand in fact hiswrists are 9.5 inches thick now hewasn't always massive but when he was akid he started joining loads of sportsclubs and also did wrestling and now atage 32 dennis is around six feet and oneinch tall and weighs over 300 pounds andhis biceps measure at 25 inches whichmakes them the largest in ukraine andrussia and this guy is one of the bestarm wrestlers in the world and i can seewhy this guy would destroy the otherperson's hands just by holding them infact i went to a scientific researcherwho made this image to show what wouldhappen to my hands if i tried to armwrestle this guy[Music]holy [ __ ] i'm just kidding guys but ifyou think i'm exaggerating about how bigthis guy's hands are then here's a videoof him breaking walnuts with his barehands[Music]so coming up next is our lindo de soyuzanow this guy's a lot like romario dossantos elvis and that's because he'sfrom brazil as well and he also did thealcohol and oil trick to make his armsmassive but this guy used it more but inless places and this is a result he has29 inch biceps which is the biggest inthe world and a lot like romario hisfriends have also died from doing this[ __ ] but for some reason he thought wellwhat's more important having freakishlylarge arms or living well it's pretty[ __ ] obvious right i need to creepout as many people as possible and a lotlike half for julius bondsen he's alsonicknamed the mountain is it just me oris this guy like a few of the people onthis list rolled into one anyway he sayshe was inspired by arnold schwarzeneggerand ever since he saw him in movies whenhe was younger he said he felt like heneeds to be as big as him now i know alot of people say arnold schwarzeneggertook steroids but i'm pretty sure henever injected jack daniels andmcdonald's cooking oil into his goddamnarms anyway here's a clip so you can seehow thick this guy's arms really are andtrust me it looks even worse on video[Applause]and next up is yao ming so this isanother giant who used his disability ofgiantism to his advantage and this guyactually took my advice that i gavebefore and became a basketball playerbut if he's so famous then what haven'ti heard of him well that's because he'smainly famous in china but hey it'sstill famous and he's also pretty wellknown in america so he played for theshanghai sharks which is the bestbasketball team in china and he evenplayed for the nba for around nine yearsand he played for the houston rocketsanyway the reason this guy was a giantwas because of some kind of hormoneproblem which caused him to grow toseven feet and six inches and he lookspretty skinny in these photos but heweighed nearly 350 pounds i mean that'show you know this guy's tall i mean heweighed so much but it wasn't fat it wasjust because there's so much of himbecause he's so tall anyway here's a fewclips of him being in the mbaplayers in the entire nbaand coming up last on this list is vikasupal so this guy was from india and hewas india's tallest man and he was aninsane eight feet and two inches talland what sucks is that even though hewanted people to know about him theguinness world records never got aroundto measuring him i mean is it reallythat hard i mean if i worked there and iknew about an eight feet tall man i'dmake

T8Ffq1X1ygQ,Why Nobody Wants This Part of Africa,1142293,41508,1018,this video is made possible by made inget 15 off your first order for anycookware you want by following the linkdown in the description this is a map ofthe world and you'll notice by lookingat it long enough that it's completelyfull of countries today there's at least195 countries that exist in the worldand at face value it seems like thereisn't anywhere to go besides the world'soceans if you want to get away from allof them but that isn't really true ifyou zoom in close enough and over to theright areas you'll see that about onepercent of Earth's land area remainsunclaimed by any country entity orperson and theoretically this onepercent of Earth's land is a lawlessuninhabited and wild Zone outside of thecontrol of humanity for all intents andpurposes these lands are basically onthe same legal footing as the surface ofthe Moon and yet their actual placesright here the you can go and visitright now however most of all thisunclaimed land is located right here inAntarctica it's called Mary Birdland andwhile it's about the same size asMongolia basically just a frozenWasteland right now like the rest ofAntarctica and well that's the gist ofwhy nobody has ever bothered enough toclaim it over 99 of Earth's unclaimedland is all right here which is kindaboring because visiting it is difficultnobody lives anywhere close to it andAntarctica wasn't even discovered until200 years ago so it all kind of makessense why nobody would have everbothered here the other unclaimed landson the other hand are much moreinteresting because despite being a lotsmaller an area one is located on thecontinent where Humanity began in thefirst place which is odd because you'dfigure somebody would have gotten aroundto it already it's located right here inAfrica and it's called beer toil despitebeing sandwiched between Egypt and thenorth with a population of a hundredmillion people and Sudan in the Southwith a population of 43 million peopleneither government claims beer to wheeland neither does any other countryperson or entity on the planet not asingle person lives here and it's aboutthe size of Luxembourg in Europe becausenobody lives here there aren't any roadstowns or any development whatsoever it'sliterally just an empty luxembourg-sizedplot of land in the middle of the SaharaDesert full of absolutely nothing butsand and rocks since there isn't anygovernment and there aren't any laws itmeans that you can basically just showup here and then do whatever you wantincluding attempting to create your owncountry and many have already tried thatin 2014 an American Dad from Virginiashowed up and claimed to haveestablished the kingdom of North Sudanin beer to wheel with a flag that wasdesigned by his kids a few months laterafter that that's a couple Russian guysshowed up planted a Russian flag andclaimed to have established thecreatively named Kingdom of Middle Earthand then in 2017 an Indian guy showed upand claimed to have established thekingdom of Dixit after his last name andplanted his own flag all three of theseguys's claims to Bear to wheel overlapwith one another and there's been somegreat Twitter squabbling between them inthe past and I plan on joining them inthe future by claiming beer to wheel asthe kingdom of real-life lore or thekrll for short of course I have nevervisited beer to wheel but that hasn'tstopped dozens of people from claimingit before in the past and it doesn'tstop you from claiming it yourself downin the comments either with your ownclever name the point being is thatanybody can claim beer to wheel forthemselves but actually enforcing thoseclaims is rather difficult because ait's an empty plot of desert in themiddle of the Sahara and there aren'tany roads leading to it from anywhereelse so getting there is quitechallenging B it's a hostile desert inthe middle of the Sahara with noinfrastructure or development andtherefore living there is almostimpossible and C in order to be arecognized country you actually need apermanent population and infrastructurelike airports or roads to get thatpermanent population there which is hardif you don't have any resources maybeafter Jeff Bezos conquer space he'llcome after beer to wheel and turn itinto his own personal Little Kingdom buthow is this even possible in the firstplace why does this relatively largechunk of unclaimed land on Humanity'soriginal starting continent even existwell for that as with all things we canthank the British and go back a couplehundred years to see why in the early19th century Egypt was theoretically avassal of the Ottoman Empire but theywere pretty much just completelyautonomous and doing their own thinglike invading and conquering Sudanwithout necessarily getting any approvalfrom the Ottomans in Constantinople theEgyptians conquered and then ruled sedanthemselves for decades and not exactlybeing fans of this occupation the localSudanese started a rebellion againstthem in the 1870s by that point the SuezCanal had already been built in Egyptand that gave the British Empire a hugeTransportation shortcut between theirpossession of India and the BritishIsles themselves in British interests inEgypt were growing bigger and biggerwith every passing day eventually by1882 the British were worried that Egyptwas falling out of their sphere ofinfluence and determined to hold on tothe Suez Canal at all costs and by anymeans the British invaded andtransformed Egypt into a virtual Britishprotectorate but by doing this theBritish had also just thrust themselvesinto the Rebellion that was going on inSudan against the long-standing Egyptianrule because the Egyptian Rule now alsomeant British rule but what was supposedto just be a quick and easy adventure toshut down the rebellion in the Sudanturned into an 18-year-long Quagmire forboth the British and the Egyptians Sudanwas completely overrun by the rebelforces and remained that way for 18years until 1898 when it took a combinedBritish and Egyptian Army equipped withmodern machine guns and artillery toreconquer it afterwards Egypt remainedeffectively a British protectorate whileSudan was transformed into somethingcalled a condominium basically just acolony but it was jointly ruled by boththe Egyptian and the British however itreally all just basically meant thatBritain now controlled both countriessince Egypt co-ruled Sudan but they werealso just a protectorate of Britain atthe same time and so the British decidedthat they needed to draw a border tofinally settle where Egypt ended andSudan began the problem with that waslike with every other border the Britishcame up with on foreign continents andbetween foreign peoples was that a theydidn't have satellites and B they didn'treally understand or care what they wereactually doing the year after theBritish and Egyptians re-conquered Sudanthey came up with this politicalboundary between the two colonies astraight line across the 22nd parallelof latitude however this line suckedbecause it was arbitrarily drawn by someguy in London thousands of miles awayand if cut directly through land thatnomadic tribes used on both sides and itwas thought that the tribe who used thisarea was more culturally Egyptian wellthe tribe who used this area was moreculturally Sudanese so in a very rareinstance of the British Empire realizingthat their initial border didn't exactlymake very much sense they came up with arevised zigzaggy administrative boundaryIn 1902 that was separate from thepolitical border that was drawn up threeyears earlier which gave this familiarbeer to wheel area to Egypt and thisbigger area called the haleb triangleover to Sudan now for decades this neverreally mattered very much because Egyptand Sudan were both effectively ruled bythe British anyway but that began tochange by the mid 20th centuryspecifically by 1956 the global attitudetoward colonialism had greatly shiftedand the British left Egypt in Sudan tothemselves both were now freshlyindependent nations and both of them hadto choose between two different choicesfor what their border could legally befor Egypt option A was the 1899 linewhich gave them halaib and gave Sudanbeard to wheel while option b was the1902 line which gave them beer to wheeland gave Sudan Hawaii meanwhile forSudan their choices were just thereverse of these option A was the 1899line which gave them beer to wheel andgave Egypt halahib while option b wasthe 1902 line which gave them halaip andgave Egypt beer to wheel in effect bothSudan and Egypt were forced into arather unique legal situation where theyhad to choose between either halaib orbeer to wheel but absolutely not both Itcould only be one and naturally just bylooking at the map you can understandwhy both of them wanted to choosehalaiib it's about 10 times more landthan beer to wheel there were actuallyabout a thousand or so people who livedthere compared with Pier to Wheelsnobody and most importantly halaib has anice Coastline along the Red Sea whilebeer to wheel is completely landlockedhalahi is indisputably the more valuablepiece of land and as a result Egyptinsisted that the true border was the1899 straight line while Sudan insistedthat the true border was the 1902 wigglyline for decades Sudan and Egypt bothjust shared Hale Eve and kind ofadministered it together sort of like acondominium this status quo never reallybecame a big issue until 1992 thoughwhen the worst possible thing for theRegion's geopolitics could have happenedyou guessed it oil was discovered in theterritorial Waters in the Red Seadirectly next to halaib so whoevercontrolled halaib would also controlthese potential oil reserves and neitherSudan or Egypt were particularly in themood to share Sudan tried to jump aheadof Egypt by granting exploration rightsto a Canadian petroleum company Egyptdeclared that that was illegal and thenusing the 1899 border as a pretext theymoved in troops to occupy halaiib Sudanretaliated to this by alleged attemptingto assassinate Egypt's then president in1996 while he was out visiting Ethiopiaand Egypt retaliated to that by kickingout all Sudanese police and officialsfrom halaib in 2000 with tensions at anall-time high Sudan decided to withdrawall of their officials from the halaibarea and it's been de facto controlledby Egypt ever since although Sudancontinues to claim it and shows itmarked as being a part of Sudan on allofficial Sudanese Maps Egypt has sincetried to strengthen their claim on theland by investing more than 60 milliondollars into infrastructure developmentprojects and just a couple years ago in2019 they also attempted to sell oil andgas exploration rights in the waters ofhalaeb in the Red Sea to which Sudanmade a bunch of legal threats about soyeah that's why beer to wheel exists asa lawless no man's Zone in between themif either Sudan or Egypt moved in tooccupy beer to wheel it wouldimmediately mean 4 forfeiting theirclaim to the much more valuable Hala Evetriangle and neither side has ever beenwilling to make that sacrifice for morethan 65 years now and in no othercountry could really bother claiming iteither because well like I said earlierit's a tiny undeveloped unpopulated andlandlocked plot of empty desert full ofnothing but sand and rocks in the middleof two other countries but if you'restill determined to travel to beer towheel anyway and claim your own countryhere you're going to need a few thingslike roads and airports fortransportation along with farms andrestaurants to feed your population inorder to attract that population withyour restaurants you need to actually beable to create some delicious food sopeople will actually want to come and inorder to do that you need to actuallyhave some good cooking equipment and thebest place to get some of that is overat Maiden look I really

N88OE2ZCHBM,Why Millennials Are Leaving Six-Figure Tech Jobs,1113339,18997,1040,"To most workers in the US, the
perks given to those who work intech are astounding! $2,000 to
spend on a vacation anywhere inthe world. $2,500 per year for
student loans. $4,000 in babycash for new parents. That on
top of lavish offices decked outwith in-house massage parlors,
gyms and cafeterias servingfree, restaurant-quality-food.During the pandemic, in-office,
perks were replaced by money tofurnish home offices, mental
health days, and the freedom towork from home forever. In an
industry fraught withcompetition for the brightest
minds, perks have become a wayto not only attract but also
retain top talent.The benefits and perks package
alone, I would say, probably wasat least 40 or 50k.This on top of salaries that are
multiple times higher than thoseof other industries.In 2019, the average tech salary
in the US was $146,000. That'salmost three times the median
salary of public school workers,who made up the largest industry
of workers in the country in2021.But even those swanky office
spaces, six-figure salaries andunlimited time off are not
enough to keep some millennialsfrom leaving their tech jobs.I expected kind of this perfect
work environment, but it wasultimately still a big company
with a lot of those samecorporate problems that you get
in a large company.Hi there. Can you hear me?CNBC spoke to several people who
left their lucrative tech jobsto ask them one question. Why?Free team-building trips to
Hawaii and private concertsaside, the tech industry can be
stressful.I'm curious, was there a moment
for you when you startednoticing that they'd like some
of the the perks kind of startlosing their luster?A lot of these companies have
unlimited paid time off. Soundsamazing, right? What happens in
practice is a lot of people takeless than you would otherwise.
They serve dinner every day. Butthey serve it really late. So if
you want the dinner, you got tostay at the office. So it's
things like that, where it'sreally, it's a good perk, right?
But there's something about itthat makes you work more.Aaron Jack landed a coveted job
at Uber as a software engineerin 2018, after going through an
intensive coding boot camp inSan Francisco,I guess I'd never considered
that you can even get intosomething like Uber or Google. I
thought those were kind of likereserved for, you know, really
elite individuals.Jack says that Uber was the best
job he ever had. But being apart of an industry that thrives
on efficiency and innovationmeant the pace could be
unrelenting,It started out really great.
Because I was new. I was justlearning everything, right? But
the longer I actually stayed,the more yeah, the
responsibilities kept kind ofincreasing on me because I
became a critical member of myteam. I felt kind of stuck
because you get motivated tofinish and you're like, 'oh, I'm
stressed to meet this deadline.'But then you're almost on a
treadmill where you finish andthen you just get a new project.Anna Arsentieva worked as a
software engineer before leavingin December of 2020.I got my things there. About to
head out from the building. I'vebeen here for the last eight
years. I'm about to set thealarm and leave for the day, and
not for the day but actuallyleave this time.The company where she worked
didn't offer the same perks asthe big tech giants, but it did
offer a good work-life balance.Still, she felt a similar type
of pressure.What led to the burn out, it was
not the amount of hours I wasputting in, but the fact that I
will have a project, I will geteverything I can to make it
successful, as soon as thatproject ends, immediately a new
one starts.Jack and Arsentieva are not
alone. A 2018 survey by Blind,an anonymous workplace chat app,
found that over 50% of the closeto 11,500 tech workers surveyed
answered 'yes,' when asked ifthey currently suffered from job
burnout. Compare that to a 2019survey of 15,000 physicians,
only 42% of whom said that theyfelt burnt out.And the pandemic only seems to
have made things worse.So many of my clients found
themselves working all the time.Rolling out of bed in the
morning, working. Thinking,'well, I have nowhere to go this
evening so I might as well justkeep working.' Waking up on a
Saturday, 'I have nothing to do,well, I might as well just keep
going.'There is this understanding of
you're being paid well, there'sall these perks, there's, you
know, stock options. We'regiving you a lot, and in
exchange, you know, we're reallyrequiring you to work those
extra hours.A 2020 survey by bBind showed
that 68% of tech workers feltmore burnt out while working
from home than while workingfrom the office. The survey
included over 3000 employeesworking at companies like
Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook,Apple and Google.Beyond the day to day pressure,
some said stagnation played arole in their decision to leave
their tech jobs.I was looking at the trajectory
of the job over time, and Ididn't really see the growth
opportunities I wanted.In fact, a 2020 survey of more
than 4000 tech workers foundthat following salary, the
opportunity to learn new skillswas the second largest motivator
to accept a new job offer. Thesame survey found that 58% of
tech workers would leave theircurrent job for another one, if
presented new challenges andproblems to solve. Jack imagined
his life 10 years into thefuture.You're still in the same office.
You're at the same desk. Havethe same chair, same commute.
So the details change, but yourlife is kind of the same.Arsentieva agrees that the
desire to keep learning andgrowing played a part in her
decision to leave.In 2019, at the end of the year,
I was talking with my managerthat I want to do something
else, I want to learn somethingelse. And it just happened that
my interests were not alignedwith the interests or the needs
that the company had at thetime,Arsentieva persevered out of a
sense of loyalty. Her companyhad hired her with almost no
experience after she immigratedto the U.S. from Europe. But she
volunteered to leave when thecompany downsized due to the
pandemic and spent the next sixmonths studying web development.Claire Shapiro joined Google
straight out of college andquickly began pulling in a
six-figure salary. But afteryears in a number of different
roles, she felt stuck in thetech bubble.I heard from so many other
people that had other diverseexperiences outside of Google,
you know, that you can't reallyfully appreciate Google, or you
can't really understand withouthaving this kind of other
context. It did feel like well,wow, if I don't leave now, I
could stay here for the rest ofmy life.In 2018, Shapiro took a 50% pay
cut and moved to Belgium for anew position as a design
consultant for the Board ofInnovation.I thought, you know, I think the
work that I am doing is notenergizing me to the fullest.
And I think I could probablyfind that potentially outside of
Google. And I did.The tech industry is built on
entrepreneurs. So it's nosurprise that many of those who
leave their tech jobs do so tostart their own endeavors. That
was the case with Morgan DeBaun.I wanted to be an entrepreneur
full-time. I wanted to move fastand not get too attached to
having, you know, a nicesix-figure income at such a
young age.Like Shapiro, DeBaun started
working at Intuit right aftercollege and quickly moved
through the ranks. But workingas a product manager, she
noticed a blind spot in theproducts that she was helping to
develop,When we're looking at good
target users as a productmanager, which was my first
role, you create these userpersonas, right? And so you
describe the person, youdescribe the target person, what
is what do they look like? Whatdo they eat? Where do they shop?
What problems are they solving?What technology do they use?
Because you really want to haveempathy for the customer. And at
the time, it felt like everycustomer's identity was all the
same. It was these white people,middle class, and I'm like,
'wait, hold on, this can't, thiscan't be good.' And there's
clearly a disconnect here.DeBaun says that she liked her
job, but thought that she couldmake a bigger impact by founding
her own company.I don't think that there's any
tech company that's ever goingto put the black audience and
the black community and theblack customer base as their
core demographic that they'resolving for.In 2014, she launched Blavity, a
media company geared towardsblack millennials.Is there anything that tech
could have done to keep youspecifically in tech?I don't know that there's
anything that could have kept meworking at a big tech company.
As a young black woman, I just,I didn't want to fight so many
fights for the rest of my life.I think that I've made a lot
more progress outside of acorporate entity, and been able
to push a lot more techcompanies to be more diverse,
and empower black people to bein the technology industry and
be more equipped to be able toinfluence these product
decisions. Definitely more thanI could have been as being a
group director or VP at one ofthese tech companies.Jack and Shapiro have also
struck out on their own.I actually spent the better part
of, you know, six monthsdeveloping my own kind of better
coding boot camp. Freemote, thefreelance developer boot camp,
that solved a lot of theproblems of the boot camp I went
to.Although Shapiro still works on
some projects with the Board ofInnovation, she has also found
her calling as a freelanceproduct and business design
consultant.Right now I'm making less than I
made at Google, but that'spartially by design. I really am
prioritizing not as much thesalary side and more of the
work-life balance and havingexperience side of it.In an industry as competitive as
tech, top talent is crucial. Andthose who leave are doggedly
pursued to return.Google does an excellent job of
maintaining connection withpeople that leave. I had a
dedicated recruiter that I couldcall at any time that checked in
with me once a year. Asked mehow my job was going and asked
me what I was doing, you know,I get recruited still to come
back into a big tech company.And I always just like, it makes
me happy. Because I'm like,'yes, keep trying to get me back
into the system.' But I'm busy!If you didn't have this grand
vision, do you think that youwould have left tech?No, I don't think that I would
have left tech if I didn't havea vision or didn't have an
internal purpose that wasdriving me.And going back is certainly
tempting.For me, I don't think that I
would go back unless the sort ofstructure and the roles that I
would want to have kind of cameinto Google. So who knows. If
Google and I meet again, I won'tbe mad about it.After a six month hiatus,
Arsentieva got another tech job.This time as a software
engineering manager at a companythat helps match customers with
car and health insurance.Do you feel like you are less
burnt out from this job?Honestly, no. I want to give the
best I can. So I put a lot ofhours. But it's never asked of
me. Actually, in reality. Mymanager told me I should stop
working so many hours and takeit easy because they want me for
the long run, not for me to getburned out again.But stress and its impact on
mental and physical well beingisn't unique to the tech
industry. A 2021 survey of 1500workers from different industry
sectors found that 52% of therespondents are experiencing
burnout.Still, the restrictions of the
past year have given a lot ofyoung tech workers the time to
think.I think it's really hard to make
this transition into a rolewhere there aren't the perks and
the money is very different. ButI think now people are, now that
they've been away from it for ayear that it's an easier
transition.For those in tech wondering if
they should quit their jobs,Jack says it might be worth the
risk.If you're someone in tech, then
you have skills that are justintrinsically valuable. You can
always get back and do it again.",1

sleep hey guys adventure hereand in this video we'll be taking a lookat some of the best optical illusionsevermake sure you watch the video until theend to see an optical illusion that willblow your mindtrust me you've never seen anything likethis before so don't miss out on thatthe firstoptical illusion we have is this traintake a look and see is this train movingforwardsbackwards or is it switching directionsthis optical illusion is actually crazybecause if you focus hard enough you canactually switch the direction that thetrain is traveling whenever you wantthe way i do it is that i focus on thefurthest left side of the train and itstarts moving backwards and when i focuson the furthest right side of the trainit starts moving forwardstry it out for yourself right nowwatch the video until the end for 48hours of good luck the next opticalillusion we have is this hallwayillusionright now it seems like we're movingdown a regular hallway but there'sactually a way that we can change thespeed we're traveling atbasically take both of your hands andcover each side of the screenthis will make it seem like you'retraveling down the hallway really slowbut then if you move your hands andcover the middle of the hallway it willthen look like you're moving super fasttry both of them out and then evenswitch between covering the sides of thehallway and then the middlelet's check it outnext we've got an optical illusioncalled the bulge effect this one issuper interestingbasically get super close to your screenright now this will make the white lightin the picture seem really bright butthen you move back and the white lightbecomes less brightthis is super interesting and you cankeep moving forward and back from yourscreen to make the light bright and thendark over and over againtry it out for yourself right nowso right now you've got three yellowdots on your screen well there'sactually a way that we can make two ofthese three dots completely disappearstare at any one of these dots andpretty soon after the other two dotswill just completely disappearthis one is really interesting becauseyou can actually do with any of the dotson the screentry focusing on one of the yellow dotsand watch the others vanish then focuson a different dot and then the othertwo will vanish this one is superinteresting so let's check it outnext we've got the spinning ballerinaillusion take a look at this ballerinawhat way is she spinning is she spinningclockwise or counterclockwiseif you said clockwise orcounterclockwise you're right the truthis the ballerina is actually spinningboth waysthis optical illusion actually allows usto trick our brains into changing thedirection she's spinning if we focushard enough we can make the ballerinaspin whatever way we want this one is alittle hard but try it out and see ifyou can make it happennext we've got this pink circle rightnow it looks like a blank space isappearing whenever one of the pink dotsdisappears right but the spaces areactually not blank at allif you focus on the black plus sign inthe middle of the screen a green circlewill appear with the blank spaces werebeforethis one's a little hard to believe butit definitely works so stare at thisblack symbol in the middle and watch thegreen dots appear on your screennext we've got this really cool buildingoptical illusion so right now i'm goingto show you a picture of a building incolorthere's a black dot in the middle of thepicture i want you to stare at that for10 secondsafter the 10 seconds is over i will showyou the same image in black and whiteif you stare at that black dot for 10seconds the image should look like it'sin color instead of black and whitelet's check it outso if you stare at the black door in theimage you're seeing right now it shouldbe in color the truth is though thisimage is actually black and white andyour brain is tricking you into seeingcolordon't believe me rewind the video andsee for yourselfnext we've got these two pink circlesand a yellow dot in the middle this justseems like a regular photo right wellthere's actually way we can make thesetwo circles movebasically how you do this is you focuson the yellow dot in the middle of thescreenthen what you do is move your headforwards and backwards from your screendoing this will actually cause the twopink circles to start spinning this oneis super interesting and it's reallyeasy to do so try it out right nowthis next optical illusion is known asthe impossible trident focus on theright side of the image it will looklike the shape only has two cylindricalendsbut then when you focus on the left sideof the image it will look like there arethree cylindrical ends to this shapethis optical illusion is super confusingand will have you wondering how this iseven possibletake a look at this image but focus oneach side of the photo comment below howmany ends you think this shape hasthere's actually an iphone hiddensomewhere in this picture but can youfind it thoughonly a small percentage of people canactually find the iphone somewhere inthis picturei'll give you a little bit to try andfind it and then i'll reveal to youwhere the iphone is in this photoso for those of you that weren't able tofind the iphone here it is if you wereable to find it though congratulationsyou're a part of a small percentage ofpeople in the world who are able to finditlet me know in the comments if you'reable to find the iphone or if it was toohardtake a look at this elephant does ithave four or five legs this is anoptical illusion that has had manypeople tricked for years and no one hasactually been able to figure out howmany legs this elephant actually haslet me know how many you think in thecomments i personally see five but otherpeople say four so this will beinterestingtake a look at the picture for a fewmore seconds and let me knownext we've got this picture here take alook at it carefully and let me know howmany people you see in the photoi'll give you a hint it's more than youthinkall right so if you guess three thenyou're correct for those of you thatdon't see three people there's actuallytwo people standing in front of thewater which is pretty obvious but thenthe third person is actually a babythis baby is made up of the outlines ofthe tree if you look at it right nowif you got this one correct you'reactually a genius see this black andwhite picture of these buildings on yourscreen right nowwell i'm actually going to show you guysan optical illusion which will make themseem like they're coloredtake a look at the same image but focuson the dot in the middle after 10seconds i'm going to show you the blackand white picture i just showed youbefore but if you focus on the circuitwill actually be colored now this one isactually mind-blowing so focus on thedot in the middle of your screennext we've got this cat optical illusionthis one has caused huge debate onlineas wellcarefully look at this picture and letme

i'mhearing a load of nothingobviously just like all of us thedetectives are gonna be on the lookoutto try and figure out who the impostersareso i think it's pretty normal that theywould be looking around howeverthere is always the chance that thedetectives could be the imposters so wedo have to keep our eyes on them i'mgoing to vote skipi'm going to skip as well me too it's askipi just don't know which one to vote forso i'll skip but i'm going to be keepingmy eyeon those two i know who is safedetective whydarren morgan i vote jill idid see martin and he did looksuspicious soi do think i'm

vpW0YP-ELx0,SHE ALMOST FELL OFF THE ROLLER COASTER! - GONE WRONG,5350343,82628,3357,what's going on they're all coming outyeah I saw a few earlier I got a showerlike there they are why are these thingswhat the [ __ ] yo I am so close tocanceling this lease I'm so close how dothey come here and spray so much bugkilling stuff and they're still hereyeah I don't know what's up guys how youguys doing today so right now as you cansee Lizzy was just complaining aboutthere's little net things I don't knowwhat they are we seem to have gotten ridof the ant problem but these littlegnats they're actually like bigger thanthat sore little flies I have no ideawhat they are they keep coming off whatare you doing hiding I'll be able toshow them yeah well we have a personcoming up right now that's gonna take alook and we're gonna try and clear itout but seriously like this has beensuch a problem ever since I got back tothis apartment it's just like kind ofgetting annoying because we've had themcome up about four or five times we'reready to try and solve this problem andit's still an issue you probably can'tsee it but Lizzy caught one in this bagof the squirming around right now it's alittle black dot what it got out of thebag you know what they are they'rebutthole eaters they're gonna eat you[ __ ] alive play it's like you [ __ ]wake up and your balls missing I'mplaying around but bro what are thesethings I have no idea I've never seenthem beforethey're like bigger than that so but notas big as what all right where yousaying these things I see it it's likeblending and they usually come out ofthe sink area see those three holes intothe sinkI like killed so many of them beforethey all come out of there already so wejust had the guy come up here and hesaid he's gonna pump some bleach intothe sink in a couple of hours they'reactually called sewage flies and theykeep coming up from in the sewage soit's like I don't know what we can doabout the situation but they're gonnatry and fix it but he was alsomentioning something about like our airconditioning to me and Lizzy completelyagreed on like it's always freezingin my room but it never gets cold out inhere or in that room so what they'retrying to do is lower theair-conditioning in this room and makeit a little bit colder out here when youhave the air-conditioning runningbecause there's been a bunch of peoplecomplaining about that as well I haven'teven said a word because I just thoughtthat's how it was designedor because there's a lot of lightgetting through in here which is makingit hot because we have all these windowswrapping around but if they get thatproblem fixed that's awesome becauseit's always freezing cold in our bedroomat night time and we wake up freezingbut it will be like just normal out hereit feels like noise and it's weird likeif we leave the apartment like tonightwhen we leave we'll leave these doorsopen so it ventilates out here and itstill doesn't Beverly do anything likeit's still hot out here and freezing inthe night yeah it just doesn't make anysenseso they said they're gonna work on thattoo which is pretty cool because Ididn't even complain about that and herewe aretime to eat hmm did you purposely make asmall one no sorry for anything likethat little chocolate chip popping uppancakes two days in a row down butthey're pretty damn good she putschocolate tips on normal as always heythat's not nice well you I just realizedthat the last thing I recorded wasbreakfast which was like three hours agoso I'm finally picking back up thecamera right now Lizzie

totonight it's like this Halloween hauntedtrail thing I'm not really sure theyhave a red carpet that they're callingit a black heart but I guess justbecause it's like Halloween themed andthen apparently they have all thesemazes and trails and rides and stuffthat we get to go on so I think thatwould be pretty cool and it would it'lldefinitely be awesome vlog footage sureyou guys Oh Lizzie actually wants to tryat least two videos next week she wasuploading like every Thursday before butyou want to upload one one day right nowand she wanted to do the cinnamonchallenge cuz she's never done it beforeI've done it a few times before I shouldbe pretty funny we just have to go tothe store really quick grabsome smells like rotten in thisWalgreens you smell it yeah it's like alot I don't know what it is but we gotto cinnamon now and you ready for thisyou see she doesn't know what she'sexpected it's pretty badmy board just keeps rocking back andforth it probably can't get stableit's like slowing down now so we'reheaded downstairs right now to do thecinnamon challenge outside because wedon't want to do with my apartmentsgonna make a mess but he's bringing afriggin ladle I think

drainyou don't feel good it was pretty funnyso since we're trying to clean it upover here or lance and I are trying tofill this big bucket up and down thebucket so we're good now hopefullyhopefully it's nice to take ten years tofill up though I know because low thisthing's filling up not even like halfwayyeah not even a quarter I don't feellike waiting all this time so let's seeif this does the trick or notdo a little bit betterI think it just spreaded it overeverywhere you don't feel good but fromthat challenge messed up your stomachI'm gonna have to come back down to likeI'm gonna get like a broom or somethingshe just randomly found this bucketunder the sink in here under this drawerI guess you are covered in cinnamon likeit's all over you knowI told her I was like don't sit downdon't

trying to get those bugsout me and Lizzy just got all dressedand ready once again we are running lateto this event I didn't know that it wasan hour and a half drive away I thoughtit was gonna be like

kgv9fMcjINc,I WAS POSSESSED (ACTUAL FOOTAGE),6163215,137208,34510,"this friggin poster fell again it just
fell right now and Lindsay and raychelboth looked at each other leg what's
that you got to be kidding methis thing is so sturdy on this wall I
don't understand what keeps fallingwatch this I'm going to barely place it
on here and try and push it downlook barely put it on there I'm putting
forslike you can hear it look it's not
coming off and I didn't even push it inusually when Lizzie puts the sign up
look you can even hear it like rip offthe wall because of the tape like she
legit pushes it in like this how is itgoing to come off like how did it come
off without even hearing like the taperipping or anything off the wall I don't
understand that look see how like tightthat is on there and I guarantee it'll
fall off again I don't understand thisthing there's something about this
poster that it's supposed to be like asign I guess or the friggin demon or
whatever it is in our apartment it's asign for us to keep our shoes off that's
what that well yeah that's what it saystake your shoes off
but I don't know maybe maybe the demondoesn't like that time for some reason
what's up guys how you guys doing todaystarting off the day with another weird
incident that sign I don't really knowyesterday if you guys haven't seen the
video yet I legitimately woke up withscratches all on my back and the
scratches are still there but they'restarting to clear up a little bit I
don't know how it happened I woke uparound 6 a.m. and I had all these crazy
scratches on my back it hurt so bad italmost felt like I was being branded if
you guys don't I'm talking about whereyou get hot metal and like brand
somebody and then they have like a legologo or something on them that's what it
felt like it felt like super hot andirritated and just hurt the whole day
but it was super weird because that waslike the only thing that happened weird
yesterday not really anything else crazyhappened it was just like in the morning
woke up and I had all these lines on myback and then literally nothing
throughout the rest of the day happenedso those pretty weird because usually at
least like one or two things happenagain like throughout the rest of the
day where something might end up fallingor just something ends up moving weird
like I don't even know vo what are youdoing how did you keep getting a hold of
this stuff he's chewing up something Ithink this is like there's some type of
hardwood from something no I'm gettingit out of your mouth boy hey ain't that
now he's looking for you so confusedlike why'd you take it from me so we got
another fan package and they actuallysent this work what was that oh my gosh
they sent us wild animal light upballoons we gotta try this out tonight
that's pretty dope thank you this isfrom those are Hernandez this is
definitely Theo's favorite spot to sleephe always goes on top of everyone's
choose to lay in this corner his head isinside of Chris's shoe hey Tony I got a
gift for you bro world small condom brohow it go even kind of looks like me oh
it does when I used to have like mybeard before I shared before I came out
here this is oh I think this is too bighonestly you think yeah definitely too
big yeah what because of a smaller sizeyeah what's dis return it you can't
return I'm about to be heading out to ameeting I gotta handle a couple business
stuff real quick and then when I comeback I think we're actually gonna go out
to this place near the beach it's calleda rock and brews you went there before
with Cody and Rachel and it was honestlypretty good so probably end up getting
food there I definitely need to get ahaircut at some point if you guys see my
hair right now it's been making likethis weird indent for the past like
couple days whenever I do my hair that'show I know my hair get really really
long I definitely need to get a cutbecause it's not like it's gonna keep
doing that little indent the way my hairis is like a weird kalak that I have and
I know it's pretty annoying so I'm gonnatry and get a haircut this week at some
point as well I don't like it thoughit's weird yeah yeah I do I don't like
it with you but yeah it's just like ayou to shave your head completely bald
like mr. Queen Ball 100 grand okay let'sbe realistic glance one of my squeal
O'NealI don't grow I care a lot about my hair
I don't think you would accept any kindof money to shave his head would you dye
your hair at least I'm gonna dye mineI'm gonna do it that color that I showed
you what should I say here know if youwant he wants to do it like all white it
wasn't why it was like it's not bleachit's not Italy no they'd like it's like
white gray oma it's like a dynamite overtight
grandpa hair yeah like I already havegray hair so I figured I might as well
just make them all match you know whenyou have gray hair when they're like 24
years old couple answer I love astressful life okay if that's not
you do revolution lately all right letme hit this music you know it's weird
now that I think about it I told youguys earlier in the vlog that nothing
really weird has happened sinceyesterday since I got all those
scratches on my back and I specificallysaid after I got the scratches on my
back of our world cup I was like youknow I'm done like I'm done playing with
the Ouija board I'm not playing withthat anymore and I'm also not doing that
notepad thing I haven't touched it sincethen and nothing really weird has
happened since then I mean of course theposter fell this morning it keeps
falling I have no idea why but likenothing too outlandish or weird has gone
on since then so I'm wondering if maybethat's all I have to do is just stop
playing with the Ouija board entirely orwith the notepad thing entirely but I
mean it's still not adding up to mebecause even after we got the priest I
stopped playing with the Ouija board forlike a day and still weird stuff was
happening I'm not really sure this isjust all like really confusing tonight
just wrapped up the meeting went prettywell but I wanted to tell you guys about
something that Aidan just texted me sowe posted a video and in the frame of
his video you can see like a ghostfigure on the door behind him it's
really freaky and if you look closeenough it like you can see the
full-blown face it's pretty weird I knowit's a little hard to see cuz there's a
glare but you guys see the face rightthere where my thumb is it's like a

Wow. Out of all the phones you could have stolenYou stole the one dude who was live on Twitch. Well, guess what?Now thousands of people have seen your face and now thousands of people knowYou're a thief and now thousands of people are gonna report you to the police. You're gonna be really easy to findI'm not saying you should ever a rob but like come on so stupid it's bad enough already as it isYou're a thief but you're also stupidOkayGirls walking just going for a strollI'm I was that way like what's gonna happ-A pole happened. A POLE. I mean, I can't even make fun of her that much because II did see it, I did see it.We all saw it. I can't make fun of her too much because I do that all the timeI'm never paying attention and then I walk into poles. At least she says she's been drinking. I have no excuseSo this girl thinks she's getting into her uber. The guy thinks he's picking up a girl... if you know what I meanIt's just she's getting in the front cuz the back doors locked because he does he's not an uber driver. He's picking up... ""a girl""So he wants her to turn it off because what he's doing is illegalAnd she wants to keep it on because she just thinks she's getting an uber driverSo she's like, ""What?!""But I guess if like you own a car and you're Ubering people you have the right to tell you and left to filmRight. Do you? It's your car. I don't know what the rules areIt's not recording don't worry it's not recordingIt's not recording or anything, just thousands and thousands and thousands maybe millions and millions of people are watching. Who knows?I mean, I don't know how many times this video got shared but a lot of people have seen thisYeah, just talking to my friends, you know just 1, 2... million peopleooo this...This is terrifying.Like this is why when you order an uber you always gotta check the app and make sure the license plate matches the license plateOf the car you get intoHello? You're looking for Caroline, right?From Washington DC I live hereOh my gosh, she's scared now because the person who just called (hello?) was the uber driverShe was supposed to get into the car with and they uber drivers like hey, where are you?My heart would be racing at this point. She thinks she's getting kidnapped. He's not trying to kidnap her to be fair, buuuuuuuuuuuutStill. Are you an uber? No.Oh my God. Drop me off. Oh my GodOkay, thank youMisunderstanding?!! That is terrifyingSo this is streaming. Okay and his mom walks in behind him while he's streaming and she's in her underwearHella awkward. I don't know what's more awkward, for him or his mom. Either way, it sucksThis is why I don't stream, like you never know what's gonna happen. This next one is a messed-up story,Okay? You see this dude, looks fairly nice, right? He is supposedly disabled. Okay untilUntil he just walks offWith his feet! Like a miracle just happened. Yeah, you saw that. So what he was doing is he's pretending to be disabledSo he could get donations. Isn't that really horrible of someone to do?Like you should never fake something to get something because what did that thing actually ever happens?You don't know how this universe works how horrible you're gonna feel then like the people who like pretendSomeone's died so they can call in sickIt's like how are you gonna feel if that person actually dies? HorribleRight?
Like you never ever ever want to make up somethingNegative just to get something positive because what goes around comes around, people. I guess he forgot his webcam was onI don't know what happenedBut dude, you stood up one way some way some day lies always come out and this is proofThis one is insaneSo this dude is playing with matches on stream, which I think you should just never play with matches everBut I mean, I guess like what if you want to light a candle? I don't know but this goes horribly wrongSo wrong, that this dude throws the lit match into the garbage behind him aaaandThen the garbage like on fire and then sets his whole house on fireHe lives with other people. Luckily everyone got out it safeNobody was injured but this dude just burned his house down live on streamI've heard of crazy things happening stream, but this takes the cakeI don't understand what he's doing. Is he trying to make a bigger fire? You know, just add some cardboard to itLet's just give fuel to the fire like you are making it worseYeah, flammable things. Put flammable things on top of the fire. That's gonna help. Yeeeeeeeaaaaahhhhhh.I don't I feel like it just this is just common senseWould you put paper on top of fire to take out the fire?No, you would probably put like a wet towel on top of a fire or waterI don't know, anything but paper and cardboard is what I'm saying? Oh waitOh, he's finally coming in the water after he's made it massiveI feel like a wet towels at best scenariobut at this point like this pointyou just gotta call 9-1-1 like you gotta call 9-1-1 get theFirefighters in there to do this job because dude, you don't know what you're doing. I'm terrifiedOkay, so this dude's just playing games and OhMic attackI mean, I can't say I've never done that this pink mic has hit me in the face more times than I can countBut at least it got it got a little soft stuff on itSo like doesn't hurt his looks like his looks like it would hurt. Like you could lose a tooth with that thing she's just taking out a door on streamOhhhhI like saw that happen before it happened. Oh, I want some of that food , I want some of thatHer reactionWas so adorable she was likeThat was so cuteI just wanted to hug her after but also I hope she's okay, and there was no broken glass. So this girl thought her stream was offShe started acting pretty weird. UHH OMAGAHH BLUGGH OOOHLike I'm sure we're all weird on our own timeBut yeahI guess I guess you gotta be a little extra careful when you're a streamer, and by a little I mean a lot more carefulSo this girl's streaming in public at a barok, ok cheerscheers*mouth drop*ha everyone went quietNo one's gonna help her up? Come on people help the girl up!I'm glad this guy eventually went but first he enjoyed the show. He was like, (welp. nvmd). But THAT was a bad fallShe like took the chair with her and everything. Okay, so they're driving and streaming whichHonestly Wowwww I was just gonna say is very irresponsible and this is whyI really don't think you should be filming,Texting, doing anything that distracts you from the road when you're driving because you don't realize how powerful a car isI understand you might think you're the best driver in the worldBut you don't know how other people drive and also, how horrible would you feel if you hurt someone? It's not goodThere's a lot of people who love you too like you don't wanna do anythingWhile you're in the car except for drive that distracts you from drivingHow many times I need to say this? At least like ten more times?Like people need to just stop doing it. Anyways, guys. I hope you enjoyed this video. I love you all so MUUUCHHStay awesome.

and I wanted to talk about thisfor a few days now but I've just been sobusy with moving into my new house thatI really haven't had time to puttogether something like this andactually talk about this I've had othervideos planned so that's why I'm doingthis video today there was somethingvery scary and creepy going on in GTA 5that I thought I would let you guys knowabout because apparently you guysshouldn't play GTA 5 at 3 a.m. weirdright I I was like kind of confused atfirst when I heard about this apparentlythere's some [ __ ] going on in GTA thatyou don't want a witness and a lot ofpeople are telling me not to sign in toGTA 5 at 3 a.m. not to do it and Iwanted to know why what what was themain reason behind this I was a littlebit confused at first so I do a littlebit of a research on this and I'mlooking around and I come to find outthat there's something very scary goingon in the tunnels at 3 a.m. and when Isay 3 a.m. guys I mean 3 a.m. in gamenow I haven't played GTA 5 within thepast I would say we I've just been sobusy with other stuff right now I'mmoving into a new place and I'm actuallyin that place right now but I'm movingfurniture in so I've just been reallybusy and I haven't had time to actuallyplay GTA 5 but apparently there's a lotof players that are going into tunnelsand saying it's very spooky and supersuper creepy at 3 a.m. because don'tknow about the sewers in GTA 5 a lot ofare already suspected that the sewersare either haunted or there's some typeof monster known as rap man that livesin the sewers that no one has ever seenbefore but there are a few leaked imagesapparently and it's scary you know thatthe myth of rap man is just a littleweary okay and there's ghosts in thegame already that makes makes GTA v abit spooky but apparently there areplayers going down in the sewers of LosSantos at 3:00 a.m. and experiencingsome very very scary paranormal kind ofkind of things going on and I mean Imean weird sounds not only is therebanging down there but people arehearing a lot of footsteps running likeI'm talking about like speed runningit's known that rap man has a tendencyof being very very fast being able torun out 100 miles an hour plus you knowI'm talking about really really fastwhich is very scary to even think aboutthat's that's just spooky in itself soplayers are legit going in the sewersand just testing this out I mean playersall around nude like players all overare going in the sewers whether that'sin GTA 5 online or single-player around3 a.m. and exploring the sewers initself and literally just exploring thewhole entire thing trying to find outwhat this is where it's coming from whoit is if it's Rat Man if it's maybe aghost maybe they have ghosts down thereI don't know I'm honestly a little lostpeople are starting to even come toconclusions that maybe just maybe alienshave something to do with this I meanthe fact that there are UFOs and grandtheft auto already aliens and grandtheft auto I would think maybe I coulddefinitely agree that this couldpossibly be an alienmaybe maybe layer a lot of people havebeen saying maybe there's aliens hiddenin the tunnels in the sewers likethere's tunnels within the walls of thesewers and maybe that could be the caseI want to know from you guys know downbelow in the comments what do you guysthink this is because I'm super curiousto find out what you guys think aboutthis honestly I think this is justsomething to do with the easter-egg ofRat Man maybe or maybe some type of Eaststraight down in the in the sewers maybethat has to do with like some type ofaliens I have no clue it's reallyinteresting to see these type of thingstype of Easter eggs come about because alot of more people come together and getinterested with this like the communitycomes together and they try to you knowcrack this they try to find a way tofind out what this Easter Egg is andfinish the easter egg and and maybe ormaybe just maybe this is Morse code I'vebeen hearing that as well from a lot ofyou guys in the comments section and aswell over on Twitter that this couldpossibly be some type of Morse code maybe trying to tell you somethingor maybe Morse code to a certainlocation in Los Santos which I'm noteven sure dude you know like I said thisis just really really creepy but I wantto know from you guys legit I wanteveryone to comment down

sESRuTyfsEk,I Spent 24 Hours Straight In Prison - Challenge,85546693,1649332,41455,"- We will be spending 24 hoursin this insane asylum.
- Yay.- But we're gonna do it a
little different this time.There are two teams. Team red. Team black.Whichever team survives the
longest in this insane asylum,which by the way, they
can't use their arms.They're all wrapped up.Whichever team survives
the longest gets 10 grand.Last thing we are doing different
is there to be no deals.If you even mention a deal, you lose.The other team gets to
10 grand. Video over.All right. You guys ready?- Yeah.
- Yeah.- All right. See you guys in three days.- Ah. Ah. Tea bagged.- The call duty classic.- All right.How long do you think
you're gonna last, Ethan?- Ah. What is time? 24 hours. Easy.- Okay.Chris, how long do you
think you're gonna last?- Banana sundae.- We'll just leave Chandler alone.How about you? How long do
you think you're gonna last?- I'm gonna just beat Chris and Ethanand I just have to keep Chandler in hereso then we're gonna win.- Oh yeah. You have Chandler on your team.Chandler's 0 for 5 in challenges.- I mean he's bound to win
sooner or later, right?That's my theory.- Insanity is repeating the same thingover and over again and
expecting a different outcome.- Oh, yeah.- What are you doing?- Huh?- Ethan will last the longest.
There's no doubt in my mind.However, getting Chris out
is the key to us winning.- There's a key to the door?- Yes. And his name's Chris.- Seriously, guys.We'll see you in about an hour.
We'll do our first checkup.If you have anything to say,say it to the camera right there,or say it to the security camera.To be honest, they're

Please go back down.Go back down!- We're literally ten minutes inand we're already going insane.- I'm gonna go in there,lay on the floor and just do snow angelsand not say a single thing
and see how they react.- The door. Ah. The door.- Get back. Get back.- Hey. Hey, get him.Perfect way to block
him. Against the wall.What you gonna do now, boy?- I was gonna walk in

He's ready to go.- Don't let him out, Garrett.- All right. Check the cameras.- Am I good?- You are not good.- I'm not good?- You're not good. It is not clear.- I need you guys on
that wall so I can leave.Garrett, open the door.- You're good.Ah.- Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine.

megaphone on siren modeand throw it in there,'cause they have no way of turning it off.- Ah. They turned it off.Hey! You weren't supposed
to be able to turn it off.- You suck.Ahhh!Jimmy is not as smart as us!- I'm gonna go retrieve the megaphone.I'm bringing a weapon with me.An umbrella.Stay back.I came here for the
megaphone and nothing else.Get away.Give it to me.Get back.Get. Hey. Get back. Get back.Hey. Hey.You guys have been bad
boys. We'll be back.Cameraman, let's go.I got your six.Stay back.- All right. I'm about
to turn off the lightsand then make the hue lights flicker.- Uh-oh. Um.- You got it, Garrett. Don't worry.You can figure out how
to turn the lights redany second now.Garrett, you're doing great.- This time we're gonna put
a piece of duct tape over itso they can't turn it off.We're gonna train them to act right.- Oh.- How'd they get past the duct tape?They don't have arms.All right. We're coming
back bigger and strongernext time, then.- I doubt it!- Mark my words.- Get him. Get him.- No. No. No. No. No. Get away from me.- Not again. I'm sorry.- Get him. Get him. Get him.- Ah!- I broke it, though.- Bad boy.
- Bad boy.- I'm smarter than you.- No one checked on him.Is he still alive?- He's good, bro.- Hey. Just checking.Making sure you're still alive.- Step out.- Oh! Yes!- He has a weapon!
- A weapon!- All right.You guys are the worst guards ever.- Ah!Wrong arm.Ha-ha-ha!- Ah!No!- For what, then?- Should I scream?- Yes.- Ahhh!- You folks just blow in from stupid town?- I haven't mentioned this yet,but they get a bathroom break.It's time for their first one.All right. Who wants to go first?- Don't look at me.- Oh, what are they doing?- Watching Chandler while he pee's.- Dude, I don't even
know if I can like, pee.- Chandler, you clearly
didn't have to pee.- Dude, I'm about to.
Can you just shut up?- Can you adjust?- No, I can't.- You good?- All right.- So I just had them go
and buy some Twizzlersto feed them as a nutritious little snack.So I'm just gonna go and like,sneak it through the little hole.- Hey. What are you doing?- Nothing.- Does anybody hear a noise?It sounds like somebody,
like, walking on snow?- Outside help.- Me and Chris are gonna
share the licorice.- Mm.- God. That's.♪ I don't know what I've been told ♪♪ I don't know what I've been told ♪♪ This old team ain't got no soul ♪♪ This old team ain't got no soul ♪♪ Chandler looks like he's mad ♪♪ Chandler looks like he is mad ♪♪ Sound off ♪♪ One, two ♪♪ Sound off ♪♪ Three, four ♪- Hey!Hey!- It's time for us to feed

Then, we'll skip Ethan.You want food?- He's eating this cracker.He's after my-- I'm hungry!- Don't steal Chandler's crackers.- Chandler doesn't have his'cause he always gets really hissy.I wanna see this. Hold on.- Can you just put mine on the floor?Give it that good zuck.Give it the zuck.- Doesn't it taste good?- It's got peanut butter in it.- It tastes good.- I got oatmeal stuck in my straw.- I am not helping you

- What?- I have to go poop. I'm serious.- Okay.
- Can I go poop?- Okay. Noted.How are you, Chris?- I'm doing good.- We're not gonna lose, Chandler.- Yeah, we are.
- No, we're not.- Yes, we are.- You, man. With the motivation.Motivation.- Well, all right.Guys, let's have a dance party
and then Chandler can poop.All right. It's time for a dance party.Guys, he's dancing.All right. Who's next?You guys rate who danced
better in the comment section.Chandler's second.- Hit the beat.- Yeah, let's get that right.- I don't know what to do.- Oh, this is good. This is good.Ethan said you will buy me a drink.And you will buy me the who the ho.Oh!Jiggle with it. Jiggle with it.Jiggle with it.Oh, that's like, ballet right there.- Oh, my god!- First of all, how do I
follow up with that? Like.I'm out.- Someone get their grandpa.All right. Black team won.- Yeah, boy! Whoo!- So, some of you guys
have to use the bathroomand I can potentially let
you guys use the bathroomoutside of here.Let's be real. Then then
challenge would go on forever.I'm gonna let you guys vote.If we do let you guys use
the bathroom out therewe're going to have to make
your guys' live in herelike a living nightmareor this thing is gonna go on forever.Stand on the rightif you wanna be able
to go outside and poop.Stand on the leftif you wanna have to
stay in here and poop.- I poop a lot.- We're not gonna be able to let you sleepand we're gonna have to
constantly be harassing youif we let you guys out to poop.All right.Are you sure?All right.So you're okay with us being mean?'Cause we're gonna have to be meanso this doesn't go on forever.We will let them go outside to poop.And because of that, we
gotta make this a lot harderon you guys.So you might get egged
and watered and stuff.So we were letting Chandler poop and um.- I tore my labrum and my shoulder, like,popped outta socket. And it really hurts.- Ooh!- It's loose.- We have a medical injury.Everyone.How do we deal with a medical injury?All right. So, Chandler's out.So, Chandler, you go get
your shoulder taken care of.It sucks, but nothing we can do about it.But the $10,000 prize is still here.Whoever steps out next
doesn't get anythingand the other two get 5 grand each.Whoever steps out, Zoro steps
out, you two get 5 grand.Ethan steps out, you two get 5 grand.It's still 5 grand each.Just one of you leaves,
the other two get it.- No deals, no nothing?- No deals. Nope. Yeah.- It's still-
- Yeah.No deals.
- Making sure that's-- Since Chandler got hurt,next person to leave gets nothingand the other two still get 5 grand.We're gonna have to mix it up a little bitbecause of the medical emergency.All right, guys.- All right. Bet.- So, Chris, now that Chandler's goneand it's every man for
himself, how do you feel?- It doesn't matter how
long it's gonna takewe're still gonna win.Or, I guess, not we anymore.But I'm still gonna win.Kind of sucks that Chandler went out'cause as bad as it sounds,
it would've been niceto go on home, maybe tonight or tomorrow.Even his shoulder can't win challenges.- What do you think now
that Chandler's gone?- I think doesn't matter.
'Cause I'm still gonna win.And, yeah. That's, yeah.- Again, no deals at all.How do you feel about Chandler
and his medical emergency?- I'm a little upset about it.You know, it's one v one v one.- Why are you upset? You
have a better chance-- Yeah. I know, right?Your odds just went up a lot.
You no longer have Chandler.- I wanted to be the reason
that Chandler finally won one.- Now we're gonna feed them.Hello?Brought you a little bit of food.They look dead.Okay.You can eat your food later.They don't look good.- I want food.- I need y'all awake if
we're giving you food.- Chris, wake your up.- Here's your ration.
Figure out how to eat it.Here's your ration.
Figure out how to eat it.- Thank you.- Here's your ration.
Figure out how to eat it.- Okay.- Mm.That's good.- Hey, Taylor.Taylor.I'm going home.My ears.My ears hurt really bad.A lot of you might know.'Cause my ears, the doctors
have said they're pretty sureI've blown either one
or both of my eardrums.And because my eardrums are

'cause of his ear infectionso it's just like.You guys won. You each get 5 grand.I feel bad because Chris

EgkUEKt_qmA,APEX LEGENDS MAKES NO SENSE 3,338383,23061,277,uh I have not seen this much excitementfor a makes no sense video ever I had tosiphon through over a thousand commentsto find the best ones and while some ofyou just complained about you know tapstrafing and the never-ending battlebetween mouse and keyboard andcontroller players I'm not going todiscuss any of that because that's notwhat this is about this is about peacelove and harmony you know sure Apexmakes no sense I get it but we'retalking about the lore the story we'retalking about things that don't makesense in the world of Apex Legends sofor those of you that understood theassignment thank you and to the otherhalf of you that were just asking forMirage 2.0 for noobs we'll talk aboutthat later but for now sit back relaxgrab your popcorn and enjoy anotherinstallment of[Music]game boy asks how does Siri hear theheartbeat of Pathfinder like isn'tPathfinder a robotso I discussed this briefly in sear fornoobs if you haven't checked that outalready we all know that although he isa robot he has a heart of gold maybeeven literal gold who knows the exactanatomy of Pathfinder as for Revenant Iactually don't get that Revenant isheartless he's evil so hearing hisheartbeat that clearly makes no sensebut you know what makes even less sensego to the training ground as Seer andthen aim at a dummyforeignyeah the dummies have a heartbeatthey're alive so all this time thatyou've been killing them they felt itMark 5 Cod says it's weird how when youdon't have an r301 bangalore's legendaryfinisher pushes the enemy to the groundand she actually has an R3 one in herhand like where did she get it fromshe's not using her own weapon she grabsthe enemy's weapon and uses that tofinish them so does that mean that everysingle enemy has an r301 no well thisone did but in general it doesn't matterwhat the enemy has you'll always pull upin r301 and a default one at that ughwhich is like weird I kind of wouldprefer that she would turn things intoG7 Scouts since that's like her mainweapon butforeignValentine says when Legends getrespawned why can't they use theirabilities automatically when they getout of the drop ship so if you getrevived and you come out of the dropship your abilities go on a fullcooldown like as if you just used it Ithink there's actually a logicalexplanation for this imagine you justdied everything went from it's all hereto Black nothingness you're in a voidand then out of nowhere boom you're backwouldn't you be kind of confused likeyou'd be moving around and like doingwhat you normally would do but youwouldn't even think about what's goingon it would take a couple seconds foryou to truly get back in the groove ofthingsthe gifter says that during emotesRampart can hold Sheila around but forultimate she has to be on a tripod soshe always carries Sheila around so Idon't think this is that big of an issueshe obviously has the ability to carryit honestly that would be an amazingbuff maybe Rampart could break Sheilaoff of the turret kind of like Halo 3and just walk around with her Sheila Ithink that'd be an amazing buff respawnwink wink nudge nudge but I thinkanother emote is a little more egregiouswhen you use octane's legendary emoteyou can whip out a jump pad for yourselfand you just bounce on it and it looksidentical to other jump pads but yourteammates can't use it why is this jumppad just defective this one isdefinitely more of a problemIvan says somehow Walter survives anddoesn't pass out when his arm is blownoff and just casually walks to get readyfor the Apex gamesthrow that out for me will yait's a lost causeso by the cinematics logic since hesurvived that humongous explosion butjust losing his arm as if losing yourarm is not a big deal if you can survivethat big of an explosion surely he cansurvive like a little frag grenadeexplosion rightforeignso he doesn't and this is kind ofsomething I don't understand aboutfuse's entire kit he's known to be theexplosive guy and his ultimate shoots abunch of fire yet he can still be reallyhurt by his own stuff and I think that'skind of lame based off of his own lorehe should be immune to his own grenadesI know that might be a pretty brokenbuff but come on give you something towork with hereSauron says it makes no sense howLifeline is only able to open upextended Supply bins I feel like maybePathfinder or crypto should be able to Idisagree with Pathfinder I don't thinkjust being a robot is enough of a reasonfor you to open up the extra Supply binsbut crypto he can hack everything likeeverything you can even Hack That CarePackage dropping out of the sky but ablue bin no only Lifeline I thinkkryptos should be one of the few peoplethat can do that as wellthe boy knew King Smith says thatpunching does almost more damage thanguns and proceeds to show somemathematical stuff like we get it broyou can do math chill so I think I'vediscussed this before but since you'rethe boy I'll tell you again every singleone of these Legends they work out mandude I gotta show you what kind ofworkouts they do you don't want to seeme do itand since they do these specificworkouts they can punch really wellunlike me because as you guys know it's20 21 and I still can't punch maybe I'lllearn to punch when doomfist for noobscomes out but at this rate OverWatch 2is never coming out and like I justdon't know what to do with theseOverWatch characters I never did videosfor like what do I doPablo Martinez says it makes no sensehow Seer hasn't had a collapsed skinwith little Nas X I know respawn you'remissing out on opportunity here watchfortnite release his skin that looksjust like Seer but it's little nazexjust watchunlucky ducky says when sticking aGrenade on a door and the door is brokenbefore it explodes the Granadadisappears The what this can't possiblybe trueokay so it's true uh maybe your kicksare just so strong that the velocity ofit just makes the arc star explode butexplode in a way where it's not going tomake an explosion but just breaks likeyou break the arc star that's insaneshooter masks why doesn't my motheraccept me oh man there's like amultitude of reasons I'm sorry my dudethis is an apex makes no sense not atrue new makes no sense so get yourproblems and your beautiful face out ofmy videoDre Nila says why the foo do I have tohold for a gold armor swap so you'reright gold armor is really difficult toswap but people don't give enough crapto Red armor you can barely swap fromred to purple without you holding theswap as well so although the gold armorswap hatred is there and I think it'scompletely valid I want to see some morehate towards red armor swapping as wellI'm just sayingstorm IDK says the triple take is in theMarksman rifle category but the LongbowDMR aka the designated Marksman rifle isin the sniper category that's justhilariouslike I have nothing to say I needed thisin my lifeatf06 asks why won't they buff Miragebecause they want me to sell the merchyou should check it out links are in thedescription down below and before you gomacro but Mirage got buffed in factmacro wears Mirage 2.0 so a while agolike a long long time ago I made a subgoal on Twitch that if I hit 2 000 SubsI would make Mirage 2.0 for noobs thereality is I only ever peaked at like1200 Subs so we never got even close togetting Mirage 2.0 but there is a brightside I'm no longer going to be makingMirage 2.0 and instead I'm going to bemaking Apex Legends 2.0 for noobs thiswill Encompass all of the big changes toevery Legend and the game as a wholesince I first reviewed it three yearsago this will also be a full-onre-review of the game similar to how Idid split gate 2.0 I am making this asub goal as well because I still want togrow my twitch I can't deny that thatbut this will be a much more reasonablesub goal if we hit 1 000 Subs I will bemaking this video and you're in luckbecause I'll be streaming all of nextweek and I will be doing a subathon onThursday the 9th so we could potentiallyhit that sub goal in one day havingthese sub goals isn't a way for me toput a paywall but it's a way for me toencourage you guys to

vHuFizITMdA,Turning cotton balls into cotton candy,1609573,131024,704,about two years ago i became convincedthat there was a way to turn cottonballs into edible and hopefully tastycotton candy at first this idea seemed abit ridiculousbut i knew that it should have beenpossible this is because cotton eventhough it doesn't seem like it at allis technically entirely sugar the onlyproblem is that all this sugar or morespecifically glucoseis trapped in something called celluloseas cellulose it acts like a completelydifferent material and we can use it tomake things like cotton balls andclothing at its core thoughit's all just sugar so what i dreamed ofdoing was breaking down cotton ballsback into sugarand then turning them into candy ididn't just want to make any candythoughand i specifically wanted to make cottoncandy i wanted to make literal cottoncandyto get started the first thing that ihad to dowas figure out how to even do iti had to come up with a way to breakdown the cellulose back into sugar andmy first idea was to use an enzyme thiswas because i had already used an enzymefor another project where i turnedtoilet paper into drinkable alcohol andit had worked really wellfor that one i used an enzyme calledcellulase and i was able to break downthe toilet paperwhich is also entirely cellulose thisgave me a solution of sugar which ifermented to alcohol using yeast andthen i distilled it to make my toiletpaper moonshinethe whole process ended up beingsurprisingly efficientand i figured it was the best place tostart the only issue was that the enzymei'd used wasn't pure and it was mixedwith maltodextrin and cornstarch both ofthese were sugars but they weren'tfermentable by yeast so none of itturned into alcohol and they didn't atall interfere with that project howeverfor this onei couldn't have any extra sugar floatingaround it would be almost impossible toseparate it from the sugar that i madeand it would just be a huge mess i hadto find somewhere to buy the pure enzymeand the easiest and cheapest sourceseemed to be alibaba it was pretty easyto go on find a listing and order theenzyme but actually getting what iwantedturned out to be a huge pain the firstand biggest problem was that i neverknew if it was actually going to besugar-free i always asked and they wouldconfirm that it was but it never seemedfully believable also the canadiangovernment kept seizing the packages andholding them for monthsthis one by farhad to be the worst one that i gotcustoms had apparently torn it open andrepackaged it by just throwing it into aloose plastic bag it was also brownwhich immediately told me that it wasn'tvery pure and i could tell there wassugar in it because it was sticky when itouched it it took months but ieventually got one that seemed decentand it of course arrived as ginsengextractit was an off-white but still purepowder and it didn't seem to have anyfillers or sugars when i tried it on thecotton thoughit just didn't work very well i thinkthe enzyme itself was good qualityand the cotton was just really stubborni knew that it would be a bit harder tobreak down than toilet paper but ididn't expect it to be as bad as it wasi was never really able to do it andafter trying for a whilei basically gave upabout a year later though i got reallyinspired for some reason and i decidedto attempt this project again i readevery single book article or paper thati could findand i slowly put something together mybiggest challenge was that i didn't wantto have to use any specialized equipmentor weird chemicals and i wanted it to beas simple as possible i also ideallywanted the sugar that i made to tastegoodor at the very least not poison meafter about a week i ended up coming upwith something that i thought could workinstead of using enzyme to break downthe cotton i would just use acid and theprocess seemed to be surprisingly simpleso i decided to just jump right into itand i picked up an entire bag of cottonballs i went with the large ones justbecause i felt like it and it lookedlike a lotbut it was only about 77 gramsnow the next main ingredient that ineeded was some 98concentrated sulfuric acid for all thiscotton i calculated that i needed 230grams of it and i poured it directlyonto 70 grams of icethis almost immediately caused most ofthe ice to melt and when it was alladdedi turned on the stirringwhat i was doing here was just dilutingthe sulfuric acidand bringing the concentration down from98to 75. i also used ice to do thisbecause it generated a lot of heat andthe whole solution was now probablyaround 60c or 140 fahrenheitif i'd used regular water instead of iceit probably would have violently boiledand splashedwhich wouldn't have been idealbut anyway when it looked like it wasall mixed i turned off the stirring andi let it cool down to room temperatureabout 30 minutes later it was good to goand i pulled out the stir barit was now time to add the cottonand i started with just one balli then poked it around a bitand it almost immediately startedfalling apartin general cotton's usually pretty toughand i thought that it was interesting tosee it just disintegrate it only took aminute for it to become a little gooeybloband i felt that i was ready to add therestsoi carefully loaded in a small handfuland it looked like it was barely gonnafitat first this was a bit concerningbecause this was only a small fractionof what i had to add with just a bit ofpoking around and stirring thoughit slowly disappeared into the acidi then continued adding the rest of thecotton and i was honestly a bit worriedthat it wasn't gonna be able to eat thewhole bagnow as far as i know there was no majorreaction going on hereand the cotton was just gettingdissolved i wasn't able to find muchinfo about it but it seems like thesulfuric acidwas probably just interacting with thecellulose it was forming a complexaround their hydroxyl groups whichnormally help the fibers stay tightlypacked together this was causing them toseparate and fall apart and dissolveinto the acidit really didn't seem like it was gonnaworkbut i was able to fit the whole bagnow at this point things were lookingpretty goodbut to fully dissolve the cottoni had to warm it up a bitso i dropped it into a hot water bath at50cand i let it sit there for 30 minuteswhen it was done it looked like all thecotton had disappearedand i pulled it out of the bathi then poured it into 456 milliliters ofboiling hot water this diluted the acideven more and it brought it down fromthe 75 percent that i had beforeto 27i then washed out the beaker with a bitof water to make sure that i transferredeverything and i added a thermometeri now had to keep this at 85cand even though it didn't look like muchwas happeningit was the most important stepin the other one the cotton had justbeen dissolved but hereit was actually getting chopped up thelong cellulose fibers were beingattacked by the acid and water and theywere breaking the bonds between thesugar units this type of reaction iscalled a hydrolysis reaction and theywere breaking it downinto smaller and smaller pieces i had tokeep it running like this for two hoursand in that timeit should fully break down into glucosewhen it was done it looked about thesame and i poured all of this into aneven larger beaker this one wassurrounded with ice to help cool thingsdown but it was still gonna take a whileso in the meantime i prepared somethingelse that i neededi went and got some of my food-gradecalcium carbonatewhich is basically just chalk i would beusing this to neutralize all thesulfuric acid but i couldn't just throwit in as a powder i had to make it intoa slurry and based on my calculations ineeded about 245 gramsso i measured that out and added 125 mlof wateri then stirred it around and after a fewminutes it was good to gowhen everything eventually cooled downto around room temperaturei started adding the goopy chalkit reacted almost immediately with thesulfuric acidand it was releasing a lot of co2 gasthis was all being generated as the acidwas being neutralized and the aciditself was turning into calcium sulfatethe only problem was that i had to addthe chalk in small amounts or else itwould bubble out of the beakerthis was a very slow process and it wasgoing okayuntil it eventually got a bit too thickthis happened because the calciumsulfate was practically insoluble inwaterand it was all separating outso to fix this i occasionally added someextra water to loosen things upand it seemed to helpi also added some more water to thechalk and i slowly added the rest of itat some point it really started lookingway too much like iced coffeeand it was a bit scary how much i wantedto taste it that would have been ahorrible idea thoughand it would have tasted absolutelyawfulbut anyway i was eventually done addingthe chalk and when i tested the phit told me that it was roughly neutralwhat i had now was hopefully a mixtureof calcium sulfate and dirty sugar waterand the next step was to filter iti poured in as much as i could into thefilter but it wasn't even close tofitting everything i was only able toadd what looked like half of it and iwas gonna have to do this in two batchesafter loading up as much as i could iturned on the vacuum and i startedpulling out the waterthis was all being drained into a flaskbelow the filter and i was getting somenice and cleardark liquidwhen the stuff in the filter looked dryi added some wateri then mixed it around and i was doingthis to wash out any sugar that mighthave been stuck in the calcium sulfatethis was then all pulled throughand i washed it a second timenow i had to deal with the other half ofthe stuff so i washed the filter and iadded everything that was left in thebeaker it was all just barely able tofit and i turned on the vacuumjust like before i pulled it all throughand i washed it twice with some waterin the flask belowi was left with a bunch of dark liquidthis was all hopefully some dirty sugarwater but up until nowi had no idea if i had actually made anysugar to figure this out though it wasactually pretty easyand i just had to use a glucose teststrip this is normally used to check forsugar in pee and i was a bit worriedthat it would tell me that there wasnothing howeverit actually gave me some really goodresults it told me that there was forsure glucose in thereand that there was probably a decentamount the only problem was that it wasstill full of impurities side productsand leftover acid and what i had to donext was try and clean it up a bitto do this i figured the easiest way wasto use something called a mixed ionexchange resinat first this might sound a bit fancyand it kind of isbut it's actually super simple to useit's also commonly used to purifyaquarium water so it's pretty cheap andquite easy to buyi got all my resin from amazonand all i did was put it in this plastictubenow to clean the dirty sugar solutioni just had to pour it throughas it passed over the resin it pulledout anything that was charged and thisincluded things like acid and salts thesugar itself though was a neutralmolecule and it shouldn't have beenaffected by it it even got rid of someof the color and after just one runit was looking a lot lighteri then swapped out the beaker foranother containerand i passed it all through againi was doing this just to really makesurethat i pulled out as much junk aspossiblewhen it was done i washed the resin withsome extra water and at this pointit should have been relatively purebesides the obvious orange color thereshould have been practically no salts oracidhowever the main issue now was thatthere was still way too much water and ihad to get rid of most of it so afterpouring it all into this large dish ithrew it into a food dehydratorthis is normally meant for things likepeppers or fruitand it's basically just a warm box witha fani then ran it until i felt that it waslow enough which ended up taking about35 hoursafter that i took it out and i poured itall into a beakerit was just slightly over 400 mils andnow that it was more concentrated it wasa bit darker it was also slightly acidicand it had a bit of a weird smellthis unfortunately meant that i had togo backto the ion exchange resinthis time though i did it in a differenttube that i made from a water bottlethis one had a valve at the bottom thati could closeso everything wouldn't pass throughright awayi also included a bunch of activatedcharcoal along with the resin which iwas hoping would helpwith the smell in colorafter everything was added i stirred itaroundand then i let it sit therei wasn't sure how long i had to leave itand based on almost nothing i decidedthat 5 hourswas probably goodover that time i just randomly stirredit every so oftenand it did get noticeably lighter whenit hit the 5 hour mark i opened thevalve and i drained everything outi washed everything with a bit of extrawaterand it was now hopefully cleaner theonly thing that i didn't like was thatit looked a bit cloudyto fix this i tried pouring it throughsome cotton and sea lightbut i don't think that did much ofanythingin any case what i had now was still waybetterand it no longer had a weird smellit basically just smelled like water andit also wasn't acidicthe only issue was that there was stillway too much waterso i put it back into the dehydratori then ran it until it looked like itwas almost all gonewhen i felt that it was done i pulled itout and i put it into an even smallercontainerthis one was made of silicone and if ihad made any sugar i was hoping that itwouldn't stick to itafter that i put it back in and i ran ituntil it looked like the volume stayedconstantwhen it eventually looked like it wasdonei took it outi was really hoping to see some nice andcrunchy sugarbut that of course wasn't the caseonly this part in the cornerkind of looked like it was solid ithought that maybe it was just having ahard time crystallizing so i covered itand i put it in the freezer for a coupledayswhen i took it outi thought that it was looking reallypromisinghoweverit wasn'tit was all goopy and honestly a bitdisappointingbut i was still kind of happy eventhough it wasn't nice and crunchy thetexturemore or less confirmed that it was sugarthere weren't very many other thingsthat i could have made here that wouldbe sticky and gooey like thisi wasn't exactly sure why it wasn'tcompletely solid but i figured it wasprobably because i just didn't dry itenough there was still some water inthere making it all sticky andunfortunatelyi had to get it out if i tried puttingthis into a cotton candy machineit would be an absolute messto dry it i put together this littlesetup which is just an upside down trayon a hot plate with a baking sheet ontop i then scraped off all the sugarwhich totally stuck to the silicone andi transferred it all herei slowly turned up the heating and ibrought it up to just above 100 cto boil off the wateri let it bubble like this for a whileand after several minutesit was probably pretty dryi still wasn't done though because evenwith it dryi knew that it still wouldn't work tomake cotton candy this was because i hadalready done a few basic tests usingpure glucose and it had completelyfailed i had no idea why but it onlyseemed to workwhen the glucose was partiallycaramelized so i slowly raised thetemperature of the hot plate and ibrought it up to 185 cunder this high heat the sugar washopefully caramelizingwhich actually meant that it wasre-polymerizingthis was basically the exact opposite ofwhat i did to make the sugarand i was rebuilding them back intoslightly longer chains it would still beedible thoughand it would never go back to being likecottonmy only issue here was that i had noidea how long i had to heat it forand i was also really afraid of burningiti ended up letting it go until i feltthat it looked good which took about anhour i then pulled it off the hot plateand i waited for it to cool down to roomtemperatureafter half an hour it looked exactly thesame and for a second i thought that itwas still all goopywhen i poked at it thoughit was completely solid and it alsolooked and felt like candy i was prettyhappy with how it turned outand it was a lot more sugar than ineeded it was also a lot more than iever expected to getespecially after my failures with theenzyme however the yield was technicallykind of crappy and i only got about 20gramsin theoryi probably should have gotten at least50. this meant that i had lost a lotalong the wayand i honestly have no idea where itwent i'm thinking that a lot of it mighthave gotten trapped in the exchangeresin or in all the calcium sulfateor maybe in generalthe process just wasn't super efficienteither way i never expected this processto be amazing and 20 grams was more thanenough i was also honestly still kind ofamazed that i'd even managed to get anysugar at alleven though i had done this all myself istill thought that it was hard tobelievethat this used to be a bag of cottonballsone thing though was that i still wasn't100 sure that this was sugar i mean ihad tested it with a glucose strip but ifelt that there was only one way tofully confirm it up until now i hadcompletely resisted tasting it and i wasreally anxious to try it if there wasanything else in there it would probablytaste really bad or sourand i was honestly kind of expectingthat to happenokay so i guess i'll justtaste one of the little piecesmmmit tastes pretty goodit's just caramelized sugaryeah that's it that's my whole reviewdoneokay so it was actually a lot betterthan i expected and it didn't even havea hint of a weird flavorbut anyway i guess it was now timeto try and turn it into cotton candyto do this i figured that all i neededwas a cotton candy machineand i bought one from amazonnow in theory based on the instructionsall i had to do was wait for it to heatup and drop in my sugarso i waited for about 5 or 10 minutesand i nervously took out my preciouslittle piecesi then dropped some inand i turned on the spinneri was really hoping to see some nicepuffs of cotton candy but that didn'thappenall it did was shoot out a sad brownliquidwhen i saw this i was honestly prettydisappointed yeahand i wasn't sure why it failed it justshot it all out it just shot it wasliquid sugar i just picked itbased on my small tests i was reallyexpecting it to just work but then againi'm not some sort of cotton candy mastercutit didn't work see that's what i fearedi ended up trying it a few more timesand it just never seemed to workat first i had no idea why it wasfailing like this but i started thinkingthat the melting point of my candy wasjust too lowif that were the case it might just behaving a hard time freezing as it flewthrough the airthis machine was designed for tablesugar or sucrose which melts at 186but glucose melts around 146 cand my sugar was probably even lower iwas hoping that this would have beenfixed by caramelizing it but i guess ididn't caramelize it enoughi think it just has to be morecaramelizedsoi scraped off all the sugar from my sadand failed attempts and i put it backonto the silicone baking sheet i thenheated it up again to about 200 ci had no idea how long i had to cook itfor and againi was a bit afraid of burning itover 20 minutes it darkened a bit moreand when i eventually felt that it wasgoodi took it off the heat i then let itcool down like before and i broke itinto a bunch of smaller piecesokay so i was now ready to try againand i was kind of expecting the sameresultsin theory the caramelization should havefixed things but i was a bit scaredbecause if it didn'ti was kind of out of ideas there wasonly one way to find out though and idropped some pieces into the machine[Music]i then turned it onand now i just had to waitin the meantime i got ready by climbingup on my little ladder it was a littleawkward but i found that reaching overthe camerawas the only decent way to film thisi was half expecting it to almostimmediately just shoot out as goo againbut that didn't seem to be happening infactit didn't seem to be doing much ofanything[Applause]taking a lot longeri kept waiting and i was a bit worriedthat it would just burn or something butthen there was suddenlya bunch of nice fluff i then quicklyused the stick and i tried collecting itand it was actually working the firstthing that i noticed though was that itlooked a lot thicker than regular cottoncandy i mean it was all yellow and themachine sounded like it was dyingbut it was still pretty excitingwhen it eventually looked like it wasn'tmaking anymorei turned off the machineohmy godokay so apparently that worked and eventhough it was probably the saddest andmost pathetic cotton candy i'd ever seeni was still really happy with it i alsoreally wanted to know how it tastedi meanit tastes like regular cotton candy justa lot moreburnt it's not bad butit's also not goodthe only major issue with it besideslooking and tasting like industrialgrade cotton candywas that it didn't last very long eventhough it was able to solidifyit seemed like it wanted to melt in justa few minutes it had shrank quite a bitand it had gotten a lot harderall the workall of my work to get thisbefore it completely died though i brokeoff a piece of it and i compared it to acotton ballin my opinion they were shockinglysimilar and the cotton candykind of just looked like a really usedand dirty onebut anyway in the end i guess i wassuccessful at turning cotton balls intocotton candy i mean it wasn't the mostefficient transformation and the qualitywasn't exactly the bestbut it was still a lot better than iexpectedand i'm really happy with how it turnedoutfor now though i think i'm done messingaround with sugar and i'm gonna focus onsome other projectslike turning plastic gloves into hotsauceokay so now is when i would normallyhave a sponsorship but i've decided notto have one for this video instead iwant to take the time to announce thati'm finally selling t-shirts again thefirst shirt is the original design thati sold years ago and there have been alot of people wondering where it wentthe other one is a new design andpersonallyi like how it's nice and discreetright now these shirts will only beavailable for two weeks and i'm not sureif or when they'll be available again soif you want to pick one up or justsupport the channel there's a link inthe descriptionmy goal in general with this is to bemore self-sustaining and to not rely onsponsorships anymorebut i guess i'll have to see how thisgoesas usual a big thanks goes out to all mysupporters on patreon everyone whosupports me can see all my new videos atleast 24 hours before i post them toyoutube you'll also get access to allthe older videos that i had to take downand if you support me with five dollarsor more you'll get your name at the

e09xig209cQ,World's Tallest Elephant Toothpaste Volcano (I FINALLY DID IT!!),11493836,764886,9130,"- This is what it looks liketo close out a year of your lifetrying to answer one of
life's most basic questions.Exactly how high can elephant toothpasteactually be launched into space?Now, if this looks sort of familiar,it's because this isn't my first attempt.Last year, my buddy Fletcher and Iwere here with this monster of a flaskbut with one critical oversight.We didn't make the floor stiff enoughbecause I just didn't consider
the forces to be so highthey'd lift a one ton structure
five feet into the air,and so, while that attemptdid yield a new Guinness
World record of 60 feet,I couldn't stop thinking
about just how highit could have gone if only all that stuffthat came out of the
bottom was actually forcedto come out through the top.Like, what would happen
if I spent the yeardesigning and building
something that weighed five tonsand was basically bombproof?And then what if we could just go onto make the world's
most epic surprise partyby building a massive slip
and slide skateboard ramp,along with the 26 million Orbeez pool,plus a devil's toothpaste explosiontwo and a half times
bigger than previously.Then, the only thing that would be missingwould be someone to throw
the surprise party for,and that's where my new
friend Brody comes in.Now, to understand who Brody is,all you really need to knowis that as him and his
family were going throughan incredibly difficult
time in their livesas he narrowly fought through his battleagainst blood cancer for three years,Brody used his one and
only Make-A-Wish chanceto buy a brand new ATV for
another kid with cancerHe didn't even knowwhen he heard that kid had his ATV stolen.By the way, I told my friend, Mr. Beast,this story, and he had some thoughtson what we should do about this situation.So now that we had a plan for thesurprise party and a kid who definitelydeserved the world's
most epic surprise party,it was time to return to
my buddy Dale's walnut farmin the small town of Gridley,
California and get to work.And while I'd love to take creditfor single-handedly digging
out in the entire Orbeez pitthe truth was as word got
out about Brody's story,the good people of Gridley
came out to help in droves.So Arnie here, who's been
operating a backhoe for 60 yearsvolunteered to dig the Orbeez pool,while Dave, the town master carpenter,started working on the skateboard ramp.I even harnessed some child labor to prepthe devil's toothpaste troughs.Although, it sort of backfiredwhen they began to protest against theirharsh working conditions.Which just left my nemesis,the giant elephants toothpaste flask.And this time, I was taking no chances.And so for the base,
we laid a concrete padwhich would be attached to the flaskwith 33 quarter inch boltswith a total clamping force of 80 tons.And then instead of a
structure made of two by foursthe plan was to use five tonsof steel all fused together
by the town welder, Jeff.On top of that, we designed
the flask to be 20% bigger.So now all we needed was a 20 secondbuild montage to get it all done.(upbeat music)And so as the party
construction continued onfor several days in the 105 degree heat,let me take a moment to try anddebunk a myth about elephant toothpastefloating around on the internet.There are some wildly
popular videos on YouTube,some with over 30 million viewsand hundreds of thousands of likeswhich demonstrate that when
you simply add a bunch of sodato some Orbeez and then
create a mento Sprite solutionand pour it over the top, you get this,which is pretty impressive.- Look at that.- This also works with Mentos.Why didn't Mark Rober tell us that?- Maybe he didn't want
us to break his record?- True.- Now I had a slightly
different hypothesiswhich was that these guys
were faking the scienceand lying to people for YouTube views.So as firm believers in
the scientific method,Science Bob and I tested that hypothesis.And as it turns out, if you
follow their exact methodology,then combine the mixtures
and run real fast,exactly nothing happens.And even if you don't
trust our demonstrationwell then you're gonna have to explain howthe balloon shadow
somehow stops right hereat the edge of the hole.And where these orange
globs are splashing up from,and how the hole itself
completely changes shapefrom this frame to this oneonce they've removed their layer mask.The way they actually
did that is the same wayelephant toothpaste is always made.And that's to mix the correct
amounts of hydrogen peroxidesoap and food coloring.Then you just add a catalyst
like potassium iodide.And in preparation for this year's partywe also played around withthe devil's toothpaste formula
we discovered last yearwith, at times,very interesting results.Now, as a reminder, this is
normal elephant's toothpaste,and this is devil's toothpaste.It reacts insanely fast, and
I don't give out the formulabecause it's super dangerous,
even if you are, for examplewearing some very nice protective gloves.And so back in Gridleywith Brody's arrival slated
for the next morning,the afternoon turned into the eveningas the feverish pace of workcontinued late for the
third night in a row.If this dang mega flash
somehow bested me againat least I could console
myself in the factthat it wouldn't be from lack of effort.And so when morning came with
only a few last minute bitsof preparation left to go, I
headed to a doctor's officeabout an hour and a half away
where Brody thought he flewout to see some more specialistsfor a day filled with medical tests.- Okay, we ready?- Okay. Okay. Thank you.- Fletcher and his incredible
hair also came backout to help with the surprise.And I just wanna preemptively sayI know I'm quite possibly
the world's suckiest actor.- Well. I'm Dr. Fletcher.
We got a lot of stuffto look at, testsum, 'cause today,this actually isn't a
doctor appointment at all.- And while I think I'm
being all tricky here,he later said he figured out it was meas soon as he heard my
terrible doctor accent.- What up buddy?I actually brought someone
to help us out today too.This is Fletcher. Fletcher here,He was with us last year.We did a big party.So today we're gonna do another
party and it's gonna be fun.You brought someone with you?- Gavin.- Gavin. Let's go meet Gavin.How's it going buddy?- I followed you when I was like six.I've known you for so
long. I love your videos.Oh, this is, oh, thank you.This is Fletcher.- Hi, nice to meet you.- Nice to meet you.- And that's Ila, Fletcher's sister.All right, let's bounce. Here we go.So step one is to get in the Tesla.- So, we actually have, and
I'll leave this up to you guys.We have two ways to get to Gridley.Option one is to take the Tesla.Does anyone want to
prematurely just say theywant option one?Or do you want to hear option two?- I wanna hear option two.- You sure? It's a Tesla!Okay. Option two.And again, you guys get a vote on this.Private jet.- Option two.- Option two.- Have you guys ever
ridden on a private jet?- No!- Let's ride on a private jet.- Your guys' private jet is ready.- Private jet's ready!Remember guys, act like
we've done this before.And the private jet was
definitely out of my budget,but a generous benefactor caught windof what we were doing and let us use hiswhich actually helped
because it cut the oneand a half hour drive down
to just 12 short minutes.- So guys, we just landed.- I knew it.- I knew it.- I knew it was a limo.- Only the finest.- We live in luxury!- And so after a short tripin a sweet ride, Brody had arrived.(group cheering)(upbeat music)- So now that the party was rollingand we were feeling refreshed,it was time to head over to
see some explosive chemistryin the form of six massive
devil's toothpaste troughs.Now I need to pause
here to make two points.The first is that because each
trough holds two and a halftimes more volume than
the barrels last year,we couldn't just dump it on the topbecause it reacts so fast,
the catalyst wouldn'teven make it to the bottom
before it was launched out.So each trough that contained the mixtureof the hydrogen peroxide,
soap, and food coloringbasically has a massive
syringe attached to the sidethat contains the catalyst.Then we put a big fat
pressurized air tank here.So when you open this butterfly
valve, the air would rushinto this chamber,
thereby sliding the pistonover and causing everything
to mix really well.And as you can see in real
life, this happens pretty fast.And the second is you might
notice it looks like oneof the troughs already kind of went off.And the truth is, when I walked
up, things looked like this.We tested for so many different
things to prepare for thisbut one thing we didn't
think to test was if thefood coloring manufacturer
added some new ingredientonly to the purple color.So now it randomly reacts
with hydrogen peroxideall on its own.So after a bit of leaf
blowing, we were ready to powerthrough even if we did lose twoof our six troughs to that little mishap.- Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.- 3, 2, 1.(exclamations and cheers)- Let's check it out.Yes. Oh my goodness.Oh, you can feel the heat.- Oh, it's hot.- Fletcher, we have a camera.Go get the cameras.- Where are they?- Right in the middle.- All right, I got it.- What'd you guys think?- That was crazy!- And so while I helped clean
up like a bonafide ghostbusterwe had to get all hands on deckto prepare for the
grand finale mega flask.Like last year, the idea
was to start the reactionby having these troughs dump the catalystinto the hydrogen peroxide pool below.So chemicals had to be
loaded in super carefullybecause even if a small amountsplashed out prematurely, we'd havean even more disastrous situationon our hands than with
the purple food coloring.But Brody still had no
idea that was coming.So we distracted him with
a different surprise firstin the form of some quality
time in 26 million Orbeez(upbeat music)- Submersing yourself in millionsof Orbeez is such a wild feelingbecause it's like having a squishyslippery weighted blanket compressing allaround you no matter where you move.And while we could have stayed therefor a few more hours, soon
enough, we got the messagethat the flask was in
its final preparations.So we all headed back over.And word apparently had
spread at this point.So quite a crowded gathered,
including the mayor of Gridley.So the pressure was really
on for me to finally avengethat L from last year and to
get Brody a dang world record.- Look at this.- And so with that all that was left nowwas to place all our hopes and dreamson our engineering abilities
and dump the troughs.- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.(screaming and cheering)- We actually had a
pressure sensor in the flaskand it turns out the forcepushing all the elephant toothpasteout the top is about
50 times the force youfeel when pushing against
a fully inflated football.- Oh my God, yes.- That was so cool.The mannequin.The mannequin is still there.- Wow. Oh, look at that.It's like a volcano.Whoa. See, it's still
like barfing out the top.- Oh my gosh.- Is that better than going
to the doctor's office?Look how far over it went.Wow. The flask stayed together.You got me once, elephant's toothpaste.You don't get me twice.- And in fact, when you do
a side-by-side comparisonof the max height from
last year to this year,I'm happy to report we
absolutely destroyedthe previous record by
nearly a factor of five,rising to the height of a 25
story building at 250 feet.And so with the new Guinness
World record under his beltI still had one grand
final surprise for Brody.So back at the house while
science Bob distracted the crowdwith liquid nitrogen powered
exploding watermelonsand trash can rockets nearly takingout our drone pilot Nerc in the process.I called up a friend of mine.- What up buddy?- Hi, what up MrBeast?
This is my friend Brody.We've been hanging out all day today.- How's it going?Did he do the Orbeez thing?He told me he got 25 million Orbeez.- Yeah.- Yeah. Is that more Orbeez than you did?- No.- We had a pool though.I think MrBeast has one more surprise.- Do me a favor and
turn around real quick.- Oh my God, that's your hog right there.Delivered by none other then Dale himself.Well get on buddy.It's not mine, it's yours.- And what's cool here is
this is the exact modelhe wanted to get for himselfbefore he gave it away to someone else.And he didn't do that
expecting to get something backin return, just like
those who worked so hardto put this party together for himdidn't expect anything either.Which is why I believe when
you try to be a good personit may not always come
back to you immediately,but somehow it always comes back.",0

you used to make the purchase withalso burned up in my hand okay well doyou at least have the bag what's so hardto understand about this if i hold it itburns up okay okay geez here's yourrefundyeah ii don't know what i expected[Music]hello internet welcome to food theorythe show that feeds you sweet drops ofinfo in a crunchy theory shell now we'vetalked about food mascots food myths andfood cliches but i don't think we'vetalked too much about food slogans yetthere's just so much in a slogan a fewshort words can make or break an entirebrand yokiro taco bell finger lookinggood i'm loving it have it your waythey're great every single one of thoseconjures up a specific image and feelingin my brain and it makes me want friedchicken tacos sprinkled with fries andfrosted flakes but arguably one of themost iconic and long-lived food slogansin history is the iconic m m's melts inyour mouth not in your hand even thoughit clocks in at a whopping eight wordsfor the better part of a century it'sproved to be unforgettable not tomention verifiable i mean most of theseslogans are pretty darn vague they'regreat entirely subjective therekellogg's eat fresh how fresh is freshsubway the worst though is probably i'mloving it from mcdonald's i mean what isit by eating mcdonald's am i pledging myallegiance to an alien space clown whofeeds on fear the pronoun has noantecedent anyway mars is stepping uptheir game they're putting their moneywhere their slogan is and i respect thateminem's presents a totally testableassertion right there m ms will melt inyour mouth but not in your

hand and at the same time will notmelt in your mouth let me show you howone of candy's most iconic slogans is acomplete and total lie yeah i know i'mout on a thin candy ledge with this onebut you clicked on this video so nowyou're invested and you're about tolearn way more than you wanted to knowabout the chemistry and thermodynamicsof mstrap in friends this is gonna be a funone to begin m m's have been coded in ahard shell of candy science since theirinception in 1941 80 years ago this yeartheir tidy little candy shell wasoriginally patented as a less messy wayto eat chocolate and this becameespecially useful during world war ii atthe time mres and red cross packages tosoldiers fighting overseas includedeverything that was considered essentialsome canned meat some dried fruit likeraisins 80 cigarettes obviously and youguessed it some chocolate the problemwas that while everything else arrivedintact chocolate was a melty hazardousmess it wasn't able to survive theairplane trips and transport trucks inthe literal heat of battle so when theu.s entered the war m ms entered anexclusive military contract with the usgovernment to ensure that chocolatewould arrive to troops intact in otherwords what am i doing here if it's goodenough for the greatest generationshouldn't it be good enough for theyoutube generation is an 80 year oldtrack record not enough matpat welltoday i think it's time that i stopruining only the childhoods of gen z andmillennials and give boomers an up achance i am an equal opportunitychildhood ruiner what can i say so whilem ms were vital to the war effort bypromoting a mess-free chocolateexperience that slogan is still far fromaccurate first let's look at the mainclaim of the slogan m ms do not melt inyour hand at first blush this seems likeit should be easy to prove m m's shellsare made from a blend of sugar and cornsyrup the melting point for corn syrupis146.1 degrees celsius that is295 degrees fahrenheit our hands are notcoming anywhere close to thosetemperatures normal human skintemperature is 91 degrees fahrenheitwith some areas being warmer like underyour armpit where you sometimes see kidsgetting their temperatures taken andalso you tend to be colder at yourextremities in truth your hand surfacetemperature is going to vary based onyour bmi your blood pressure airtemperature but stays roughly between 85and 95 degrees fahrenheit or 29 to 35 ceven in the hottest reliably measuredtemperatures on earth 130 degreesfahrenheit it would seem like the cornsyrup portion of the candy shell isn'tin danger of melting in your hand and ifit does somehow melt well you've gotsome bigger fires to put out as for thesucrose sugar portion of the candy shellthat one is definitely not melting inyour hand the actual melting point is366 degrees fahrenheit or 185 degreescelsius but long before the sugar ismelting it's actually reacting sugarmolecules are highly reactive especiallywith all the things in your body or morespecifically the things on your hand akasweat the two main components of sweaton your palm are water and salt and theysurround and interact with the sucrosemolecules of the candy which we usuallyjust call dissolving you know how m mssometimes leave a ring of candy dye onyour hand if they're left there for toolong that's not melting which isstrictly dependent on temperature it'sthe candy actually reacting with yoursweat by dissolving in it yeah it issuper gross and the hotter your hand themore soluble the salty water on yoursticky little palms become which meansthe more candy shell that you candissolve in there so just know that whenthe m m finally hits your mouth you'reeating some delicious chocolate wrappedin a thin coating of candy and sweat mmmtasty and when you pop into your mouththe exact same thing happens where thesugar isn't melting again based ontemperature the m m is sitting in yourmouth and dissolving in your saliva sotechnically we've already disproven someof the slogan the candy shell can't meltin your mouth or your hand because themelting point for the candy shell isjust way too high it's actuallydissolving so i think it's time we adopta more truthful slogan here mars pitchnumber one dissolves in your mouth lessso in your hand uh if you don't likethat one here's pitch number two doesn'tmelt in your mouth but you are eating alittle of your own sweat every timethen again there's always pitch numberthree where we instead choose to focuson the candy's milk chocolate insides asopposed to the candy itself m ms themilk chocolate melts in your mouth notin your hand wait i i thought it wasjust melts in your mouth not your handdid he just say the milk chocolate meltsin your mouth not in your hand hold onhold onwas it always like this no ohit was haha yeah okay sure hey guys didyou know that the m m slogan is and hasalways been about the milk chocolateyeah apparently they weren't talkingabout the candy shell at all the fullslogan has and has always been the milkchocolate melts in your mouth not inyour hand the milk chocolate melts inyour mouth not in your hand while youdon't tend to see the full sloganwritten in print in the commercials theydo voice over the full wording withtheir announcer and they do save it forlarge scale advertisements like thisprint poster from 1985 and this one andthese and all of these too so uhyeah it is definitely the chocolate andi definitely knew that this entire timeam i the only person in the world whodoesn't remember the milk chocolate bita little google trend search resultshere precisely no one in the world issearching for this complete phrase andhere's the best twist of all it doesn'teven matter mars is still wrong i'mstill gonna prove why their slogan iscomplete bunk eminem's milk chocolatedoes in fact melt in your hand that'sright mars you haven't stopped me yeti'm still coming for you we start offwith some pretty damning evidenceagainst their claim eminem's chocolatedoes have a melting point that's lowerthan body temperature between 86 and 90degrees fahrenheit which we'veestablished is practically the exacttemperature range of the average humanhand so while yes the candy coatingdoesn't melt remember the slogan isn'tabout that it's about the chocolate andthe science says that the chocolateinside would definitely melt if it werein direct contact with your hand so nowthe question is whether the candy shellis a good enough insulator to keep thechocolate inside from getting so hotthat it melts which means it's time tobring home this episode with the thingyou've all been waiting for some sweetsweet thermodynamics because the shellitself isn't melting we have no ideawhat's actually going on on the insideuntil we do some math if the sugarcoating were a perfect insulator inother words if it didn't transfer anyheat to the chocolate at all we wouldknow a hundred percent that the insideisn't gonna melt if m ms were coatedwith something like say silicone or woolwe'd be pretty sure that the milkchocolate interior isn't heating upsince silicon and wool are greatinsulators but a thin shell of sugar imean how much heat is that really goingto stop well because the internet is theinternet we can actually do thecalculation based on the thermalconductivity of sugar and corn syrupwhich are both right around 0.15 wattsper meter times k the difference intemperature between one side and theother yeah that is the unit of measureand they are just as insane as theysound suffice it to say a big numberhere means that the material is a greatconductor of heat typically metals fallinto this category about 100 watts permeters times k which is why all the potsin your kitchen are made of metal theypass the heat straight from your stovedirectly to the food the lower thenumber the better insulator the materialis like styrofoam at .003 sugar has athermal conductivity of 0.15 which isshockingly low actually a whole lotlower than i expected thereby makingsugar way better at insulating than youmight think but is it enough to protectour chocolatey centers not quite you seewhile the candy coating is a pretty darngood insulator the shell itself isincredibly thin less than a millimeterthick after trying very unsuccessfullyto measure it with a ruler i found thisincredible recursive analysis of an m mdone online by dan just just dan welldan calculates the candy shell to be0.795 millimeters thick you know whati'm inclined to take his word for itbecause this was like theorist levels ofunnecessarily rigorous so if we use allthe information out there that theinternet's gathered about eminem's likethe weight of an m m at 1.3 grams thesurface area of the shell at 3.55 squarecentimeters the conductivity of sugarand the specific heat of chocolate wecan actually calculate how much energywe would need to heat the candy shellfrom room temperature of 72 degreesfahrenheit to the melting point ofchocolate 86 degrees fahrenheit atminimum this is our equation and to saveyou the math the tldr here is that wedon't need that much energy to do itless than the energy needed to heat up acup of coffee just exposing the eminemto the heat of our hand in an indoorenvironment the chocolate inside thecandy shell won't melt instantly butshould melt after251 seconds 4.1 minutes and uh yeah iget it you don't plan on holding an m min your hand for that long especiallyafter i told you it's reacting to yoursweat the entire time but let's take thecandy outdoors at an ambient temperatureof 80 degrees fahrenheit we need lessthan half that time to start melting thechocolate 1.9 minutes if the ambienttemperature is above the melting pointof chocolate well now we're looking atless than one minute for a chocolatemeltdown 34 seconds if the outside is 90degrees and the thing is while it mightseem unfair to test the candy outdoorsin the summer heat that's actually atits most fair look at the way thesethings are marketed they're specificallyshown as a candy on the go especially inoutdoor environments look at thiscommercial from a beachside bar in thesummer where by the way this guy's justsqueezing the life out of these m m'sfor a long time here's some kids at thebeach here's one at an outdoor concerthere's one in terrible quality for thesummer olympics back in 1984 which wereheld in los angeles where it hit 105degrees fahrenheit or 41 degrees celsiusheck remember that the whole point ofthese candies in the first place wasthat you could expose them to high heatand send them overseas to the militarybut in reality it's all false in factthere's only one last thing for me to dotest em irl cue the footage of meholding m m's for an egregiously longamount of time starting the clock righthere for four minutesand now we wait honestly the hardestpart of this challengeis me not eating the eminencewell i'm standing here looking like anidiot doing science by holding a bunchof m ms in my hand you can take the timeto go down to the top line of thedescription and sign our petition to getme as the next host of jeopardy yep weare trying to convince the world thatthis man right herethis man holding m m's in his hand forscience deserves to be the next host ofjeopardy so timer's all up now it's timefor me to open up my hand and cut insidethe m m's to show you that the chocolateinside should be melted and to show youthe difference here this is a solid m mi'm pushing down on it really hard[Music]and it took a lot of effort and you canseechocolate inside is solid rightnowbased on our calculations it should havebeen about four minutes candy shellshould be intact but when i press downon it it should kind of ooze out or atleast be a lot gooier right so here wegooh god i've got so manyin my hand right now this is already notlooking too good here we gopushoh look at it oohsoohsoh yeah that is gooeyand melted it's not quite like fullyliquid it's not likeit's not liquid but it certainly ismelted so there you have it friends idon't know if this is surprising anyoneat all since were people actually askingthis question but to be fair makers of mm's the truth comes out the milkchocolate inside does in fact melt inyour hand whether or not you realize itit's just melted on the inside of yourcandy coated shell soyou knowmaybe a little bit more precision inadvertising huh at the end of the daythe m m's slogan is a hundred percentfalse every way you slice it thechocolate inside the shell isn't stayingsolid in fact it's melting most of thetime it's melting in your mouth yourhand your shirt pocket it is melting inthe bag sitting on your car seat everyday from april to october these thingsare melting everywhere the chocolatejust winds up sloshing around inside thecandy shell and when it's not meltingwell the candy shell is just dissolvingin your sweat and your saliva so marsi'm just gonna fix the slogan once andfor all you don't have to pay me forthis one you ready m ms melts inside thecandy shell which is separated from youand all the other stuff that you don'twant covered in chocolate by less than amillimeter of sugar okay i admit itdoesn't really roll off the tongue but ibelieve in truth and advertising herepeople 2021 the year of transparency form ms and now if you'll excuse me iactually really love eminem's despite mespending the last 16 minutes dunking onthem and all this science has actuallygiven me a hankering for those ones withthe rice krispies inside oh they're sogood and then there's the ones with thepeanut butter inside ah anyway i'm gonnago get those

stuff like that umgoing forward with aaw and stuff likethat is there something else that we cankind of expect from you that you bringfrom your life into into this a littlebit more maybe not that it wasn'tauthentic but that more authentic foryou being here and stuff uh no i mean ii just thinkum and i think this is a credit to tonyi think there's aeverybody speaks more authentically herebecause you're allowed to be yourselfmore and um and that's not a knock onthe place that i worked before butuh but i think you see it in people andyou see umeverybody has one of the things that ilove about this is the artisticexpression and that's something thati've that i've always loved about prowrestling is that umyou can be what you want what you wantto be or you can be who you areandi think itpretending to bea different personthat's actingtaking yourself and taking it up a notchyou actually learn a lot about yourselfi've learned so much about myselfbecause of pro wrestling and becauseof uh so when i first started or when iwas in high school actuallyi couldn't even read a book report infront of a class like and nowthrough pro wrestlingi become i can sit here and talk withyou guys and i'm not really botheredabout if i mess up or if i trip over myfeet or you know if something happensyou know what i mean and that's notand that's because of my experiences inthis from being myself like i there'snot a question anybody here could ask methat would make me nervous like youcould ask me about my sex life with mywife and i'd just be like well you knowlike i'm not going to answer that youknow most you married people with kidsknow how it isso you know like that sort of thing yeahand pro wrestling has made mecomfortable with that brian cm punkbrought up wrestling at wrigley fieldnow because we have an awful footballstadium here soldier field we can neverhave a wrestlemania here how aboutwrigley field in the summer you've everseen pug headlighting are you bookingthe build are you booking the buildingsnow i didn't know brian was booking thewrigley field punkbrianwhat happened if you'd like to take overa book in the buildings i can step asideuh soso ibriefly took part in creative in wwe andi will say thisi like just wrestling right like i youknow i'll leave i'll leave the businessstuff and uh and all that kind of stuffup to up to tony i will say this uh i iwould be remiss if i didn't mention i'mi'm so fortunate to be accompanying tohave here in aw working with us uh oneof not only the greatest wrestlers inthe ring bela bell of all time but alsoone of the great minds andhe has so much to offer to us and evenif he doesn't want to mentor people andhe wants to kick their asses i thinkwe're gonna all learn a lot from havinghim here and uh he's one of the smartestpeople i know so it's really nice to behere withyou obviously you wrestled back andforth with this decision it was not aneasy one you're not one of the peoplewho was likei never want to go back there i meanyou're you know you were happy but youknowyou were happy there you were going toprobably be happy here what went throughyour mind how did what would flip theswitch so to speakbetween the two and about how far backdid you kind of makethe call in your headso umi'd heard something i don't know overthe past week or something that uhthat one of the things thatthat really turned punk was the brodylee show that was also one of the thingsthatuh i saw it andi mean so many of us loved him so muchright and sowe saw it we saw how special it was andwe sawlike okay we're gonna stop what we'renormally doing and do that and i thoughtlikethat was that was really special to meumbut so that was when i really startedkind of thinking about it knowing thatmy contract was coming up but the butthe final decision honestly was was justlikei started thinking about things and wwewas so gracious with me as far as theoffer that they gave me they were gonnalet me go do some other stuff and umoutsidebut there's justi hate to say this there'ssometimesvince and i have a great relationshipand i love him i dosometimes he's overprotective of meand i want to be able topush my limitsthat'sone of the things that i love about thisis like the physicality of what we doout there and being able to push mylimits and being able to do that um herein a safe manner is one of the thingsthat really drew me here and thenthere's also i just think there's anexcitement you know what i mean there'sjust an excitement you see the crowd imean i think you all see it you probablywere all out there and you felt it youknow what i mean and you felthow excited people are about thisproduct and it feels vibrant and itmakes you feel like even just watchingit through a tv screen in a trailer andi'm sitting there going god this isawesome right like ii want to be a part of this right and sothat was you know uhthat was it although it wasuhi don't know i really battled back andforth because um there's a lot of peoplethere that i consider family that iactually are legitimately my family iguess and uhand you know and and people that i lovethere so you know it was a it was areally tough decisionhe came out here tonight um when youwere running down the ramp you could seeyour face and you could see every faceon the crowd and you could have pulled amirror up and it was exactly the samethe joy on your face the joy thateverybody else's face this is anotherone of those landscape shifting momentsthat youare a part of tonight we've had cm punkcoming out and that changed everythingwe have you coming out without a coltit's changing everything along with rubyhow does it feel to bein this moment on this show in chicagowith this crowd and what are you lookingforward to doing with aewis there potential that you might beutilizing the forbidden doorum soi don't know that's a lot of that's alot of stuff uh soremind me of what you just asked againso basically in essence how did it feelcoming out in this crowd with thisvibrancy of this excitement yeah andthen um the forbidden door you mentionedwanting to sort of test your limits isthat something that you might bewalking through yes but you knowwe all know we're we're in a weirdsituation within the world i mean iwould love love love love love to gowrestle in new japanwould love that but with kovid beingwhat it is right now you know what imean i can't leave my i can't quarantinefor two weeks i can't you know to go doa couple shows in japan i just can't doit i would love to wrestle in mexicoi don't know if that's the safest thingin the world for me right now you knowwhat i mean so um for right now i'mgonna focus focus on aewand then umand then go from there but as far as howit felt i mean it felt great right likeuhit wasbut i do i do want to say thistherethat is only possiblebecause of what the peoplewho started this company have builtright like thisif umthere's other wrestling companies outtherethat have great talent besides besideswwe like you know the umother companiesandi didn't hearreally anybody clamoring for me to gothere there's a reason for peopleclamoring me clamoring for me to comehere and it's because of what they'vealready builtbefore punk got here before i got herepeople were already excited about it andthen like oh imagine if you addthis person to this already fantasticmixlikethat's that'swhat gives you chills rightbrian any any wrestling moves that inthe past for some reason were bannedthat you may bring now here in awoh i'm not going to tell you thati've got a i've got a devious mind thatis thinking of devious thingssorry last question brian we tend to getcaught up in semantics of all the stuffratings key demo viewership all thattangibly what do you believe the arrivalof yourself adam cole and cm punk can dofor aw as a company where can it take iti mean i honestlytony's the businessmani couldcare less about the businesslike as far as the business end i wanthim to make moneyso that he keeps doing this thing thatis so much fun for me to do right uh andso what i want more than anything elseout of all this i don't know if you knowthis i'm the richest man who's everlived umyeah yeahpretty muchuh i grew up without much so incomparison you know i feel um so for asfar as that kind of stuff i just feel soblessedto be able to step into this positionwhereyou have a crowdthat just loves this product and you sawit tonight every match they're justinvested you know and soso for me it's not about like oh can wetake it to this or can we take it tothat i would love to help tony do that iwould love to help tony do that butuhmy my goal is to produceexcellent professional wrestling thatpeople can watch because this is one ofthe things i think this is one of thethings i truly believe you showexcellent professional wrestlingto anybodyand they will enjoy it oh yeahbecause excellent professional wrestlingis [ __ ] awesomethank you so much thank you thank youall right thank you thank you yeah thankyou guys and thank you all for coming imean thank youyeah thank you you guys are greatcovering and all that kind of stuff ican't thank uh i can't thank brianenough for his time and for doing thisand uh it's the beginning of a greatjourney and i just i really appreciateit thank you brian yeah thank you tonyand i i think uh i think we all owe tonya huge debt of gratitude as well[Music]so i will say this because i have been apart of wrestling since 1999 there was along period of time i got fired i was ina developmental system ini got hired in 2000 got fired in 2001shortly after wcw uh foldedand there wasn't a lot of other placesfor people to workand nowthere's another placethat's legitimate competitionand i think that's greatand it wouldn't happen because like icouldn't do it rightpunk could do it couldn't do it on hisown like none of us could do it on ourownwe needed somebody with a visionwith the right peopleto build somethinglike that up solikeas much as you know tonight it's like ohyaybrian anderson whatever but i think it'sthe vision of seeing something like thisbeing possible and then finding theright people and also like the peoplegosh i mean i you can't credit enoughthe people who've been here since dayone like the and especially like theyounger talent look at how much they'vestepped up and likecome like you look at darby tonight inthat ma in that match with punk likehe's the man right and who would havethought that like you know like whowould have thought that four years agoyou knownobody you know sofour years ago i i wouldn't have ihonestly wouldn't have but but you knowless than two years ago two years agoeven yeah i would have believed itpossible and that's that's how far he'scome and it's how far these people havecome because we have all these youngwrestlers and it's crazy because whenthe pandemic started i don't know if youcould say that darby was like a bigwrestling star in that sense of the wordbut he was making progress i don't knowif you'd say bret baker was a bigwrestling star in that sense of the wordbut she was making progress for jungleboy for so many sami guevara for so manypeople on this roster that are breakingthrough and have come so far like in thepandemic a lot of people really spreadtheir wings and flewyou,0

R84W2hbmaKk,The Truth About Making Cartoons,5334360,478899,3594,recently i read the worst youtubecomment ever and i can't stop thinkingabout it this comment lives in my headcompletely rent-free it lives in its ownprivate penthouse the comment wasconcerning my upload schedule and it wasif anime studios can make an episode ofanime in one week then these youtuberscan make a video in a month initially ireacted like you think that's how thisworks you think anime studios post anepisode and go great work team well timeto make the next episode this week hopenone of you have any plans i know theworking conditions in japan are bad butsheesh i guess all the animators arejust slacking off between seasons thenhuh and as i thought about it more irealized i can't get too mad this personis just uneducated about the animationindustry and is probably a minor andthen i thought hey i know a bit aboutanimation behind the scenes maybe icould talk about being an artist andeducate people on the animation pipelineso that way i won't get any moreuneducated comments for this video wheni say artist i'm going to be talkingabout the google definition of an artistnoun a person who produces paintings ordrawings as a profession or hobby youknow the pen and paper artists i'm notreally going to be talking about artistswho make music or birthday cakes or takeblack and white photos of sunsetsbecausei want to talk about cartoons i makecartoons now it should come to nosurprise that i'm a pro artistnot a pro artist are you kidding i knowmy skill level i still can't drawfingers what i'm saying is i willsupport anyone who wants to make art ifyou're making art as a hobby then that'sa really great creative outlet andhaving something physical as an endresult is incredibly rewarding but ifyou want to turn making art into afull-time job you might want to sit downand consider a few things like are yousure you don't want to go to law schoolthe biggest challenge all artists faceis they have to eat foodto survive and in this capitalistsociety food costs money so artists arechallenged to somehow take being good atmaking shapes and turn thatinto money i know of four ways an artistcan make a living the first way is to beso good at art that people will paymoney to hang it up in their house thesecond option is to make caricaturedrawings at beaches and tourist trapsthe third option is to sell your plasmaand the fourth option which is the mostcommon option is to make drawings thatpeople will pay you to make and do alittle bit of option three on the sidesome artists will take commissions whichis basically an artist going hey i'lldraw whatever you want asterix for ahundred dollars and people will gowhat the f art should be free i wasgoing to give you so much exposure to my50 twitter followersor people will go i want you to drawthis cute animal character i made andwhile at first your price might seem abit high to the uneducated i understandthat art is a time-consuming process andyou need to eat too so here's a crispone-hundo but another somewhat morestable idea is that artists will getjobs at studios or work for a youtuberand we'll be like hey we'll give youmoney if you draw specifically what wewant and if we don't like your artwe'll make sure to communicate clearlywhat we would like changed and work as ateam to do the best we canor you're fired and that leads us intoanimation an important thing to rememberfor animation is that drawings equaltime plus money exactly how much timewell to answer that one commenter'squestion no an anime studio does notmake an episode of anime in one week ithink south park is what making anepisode in a week looks like andtruthfully that's very impressive i takemonths trying to figure out what theheck i'm even going to talk about makinga single episode of a cartoon fromscratch takes about twoyears don't believe me well let's seewhat yakko from the 2020 animaniacs hasto say in the very first episode atleast we still think there's a presidenttrump you see the writers are writingthis in 2018. now that doesn't mean ittook 26 years to make the first seasonof the animaniacs there's a lot ofmoving parts that happen when producingan animated tv series for starters thewhole season of the show gets made atthe same time while the writers arewriting episode 12 the storyboard teamis boarding episode 3 and the designteam is designing the bowling shoes thatare going to be worn in episode 6. andit's someone's entire job to make surethat everyone's doing their job this iscalled the animation pipeline andthere's so many other departments that icould honestly make a whole other videoabout this pipeline if you're interestedi'll do it but just know that it takesroughly two years to make a season of acartoon show and that's why when showsreference memes they're extremelyoutdated you know like a bossit's beautiful isn't it this exteriornighttime city skyline background thisbackground was drawn by one of mybackground artists annie loomis and ittook seven hours to make and was usedspecifically for this clip if it wasn'tfor the cats movie i would have thoughthollywood knew what they were doing tooit lasted for four secondsseven hours of workfour seconds of contentso before we continue i'm gonna make youall sit and appreciate this backgroundfor another four seconds so i can doublethe value of this backgroundbackgrounds can be a time-consumingprocess and the whole purpose of them isto be in the back of the ground they'renot even the focus so storyboarders willsketch out a scene to set the stagingthrough layout posing and characterexpression and during this phase i'mtrying to find places where i can re-usebackgrounds or take pieces of otherbackgrounds and frankenstein monsterthem together to make an entirely newbackground like how i use the citybackground to be outside this window orhow i took the buildings from thisbackground the bushes from thisbackground and the bench from thisbackground and made an entirely newbackground and hopefully none of younoticed am i being cheap or cuttingcorners absolutely but that's the pointthat gives another background artistmore time to make something else likethis james themed city skyline insteadof having to draw 20 differentbackgrounds of a bedroom we already havea bedroom let's just do something elseplease it's not being lazy it's gettingthe most use the most mileage out ofyour hard work i see this next story popup on twitter about every month and itmakes me want to stab my eyes out if youlook at this scene from the jungle bookand this scene from winnie the poohthese two similarly proportioned boysare eerily moving in the exact same waywait was thisplagiarized did someone from winnie thepooh plagiarize the jungle book noremember what i said about drawingsequal time plus money well back in theold days of animation before fancygraphics cards and floppy disksanimation frames had to be physicallypainted onto floppy transparent sheetscalled cells so animated movies wereessentially a really long flipbook withover a hundred thousand hand-drawnpainted pages back then drawings equaledeven more time and even more money thiswhole sequence had to not only be drawn24 times a second but it also had tohave the correct timing to look like alittle boy was jumping on rocks justbecause you drew 24 mowgli's doesn'tmean they're gonna look good when youplay the frames together so if you'remaking a cartoon movie in the 70s andyou need a scene where a young boycharacter is just being a dude andthrowing rocks and you need a reallyclimactic fight scene are you gonnaspend the time and money drawing anotherboy throwing another rock when someoneelse already did that 10 years ago orare you gonna reuse the animation thestudio already made and then have moretime and budget to make an even epicfight scene if these movies were fromtwo different studios then yes thatwould be a completely different storybut disney owns this movement of our boymowgli so they're allowed to use thatmovement on our boy chris turning yourart into a full-time job is verydifficult i'm extremely lucky to notonly have this opportunity but to beable to build an amazing team oftalented artists to create thesecartoons and share them with you andbecause of you watching these videos andsupporting me i'm able to reinvest moneyinto the team so we can make betterquality content and i can support moreartists it's a win-win symbiotic thingwe got going on so if you ever wanted toget into the art industrygood luck get drawing and start puttingthat portfolio together i hope you allenjoyed this art rant considering thatthis video was all about artists i ofcourse have to give the biggest shoutout to all the people on my team whomade this video possible so thank youeveryone i also want to clear up a linei said about how i will support anyonewho does art obviously if your art isoffensive or harassing others thenthat's not chill i just didn't want toderail the video and give that caveat inthe middle of a video so i'm doing itnow and big news my board game cafechaos is now available in target just intime for the holidays or if you want tobuy it online the link will be in thedescription and lastly i'm going on tourwith a bunch of friends in november ifyou want to come see us play drawinggames then again check out the link

i weighed on the digital it wassnowfall and rigging gave me to motivatethe hood and do better i lost my coastso i had to wear twosweaters finallyherei got my cupthere's nothing in this but tahitiantree certified lover boyis outnow i want to tell you a couple thingsright kanye will not be mentioned inthis video damn did i play pusha t inthe beginning i did not i didn't evenmean to do that either i was justthinking about the verse on paul mollyit just happened to be a crazy verse iwant to give drake the benefit of thedoubt of just dropping an album and himnot having a thought about mr west inany capacity you know this could just bea crazy album and it'd just be great andno one have to mention it being betteror worse than donde but i know peopleare gonna do that so it does look likethis is the final cover art forcertified lover boy i'm extremelydisappointed but i'm also very excitedbecause drake has been playing into thiscertified lover boy persona for for thebetter part of his career but doing sounironically which a lot of the time canjust make him come off corny but here itseems like he's playing so deeply intoit like the album name this cover art uh[ __ ] was cutting dicks and testicles inhis forehead basically for the last yearlike he's aware of it he knows what he'sdoing i don't think that this isunironic i don't think that he's takinghimself too seriously this is the typeof drake music that i like to listen towhere he's just doing what he likes todo and it doesn't appear as if he'staking it too seriously but i doreal quickneed to discusswhat the [ __ ]this album description is a combinationof toxic masculinity and acceptance oftruth which is inevitably heartbrokenthere's no there's nothing for me tobelieve that this album won't be amazingif you are writing toxic masculinity inyour album description you know whatyou're doing this is this has all thesigns of of just like a [ __ ] that'sjust desperate for [ __ ] that's whatthis this whole ammo that's what it'sbeen this if this is unironic i'll neverlisten to him again bro imagine thisalbum is [ __ ] amazing and then wegotta look at this [ __ ] as cover artcertified lover boy track one champagnepoppyoh yeahit's hard to be unfazed trustworthything i hate most about drake islistening to his musiche's the only rapper that so many peoplemake fun of but like his pen isphenomenal when he wants it to be likeyeah he told this [ __ ] the text messageyou will never recover he like browhat have you really done to me i'munfazed worse has been donejust in the album nothing else biggerthan the ovo letterman[Music]this sample too is crazy the drums ohwhat you doing i sound like that onegirl when i was like 15 years oldand we was alone in her room or whateverand i just kind of like slid

playingviolenceoh my god that was violence anythingbesides this now we playing violins youknow the price everything but the valueof nothingso uh i do like that drake uhi think hov really dominated that trackin terms of like word playlyricism and everything like thatdrake's was cool but in comparison it'sjust likebut i will say that this whole featurethis jay z feature is way way way waybetter and actually mixed wellas opposed to the one on scorpion tracknumber six is fair trade with travisscotttravis scott what song is this that heput some money on my head i guess[Music]oh mygod oh i need to change my shirt becausethis is just crazy[Music]the dirt that they threw on my name itturned to soil when i grew about ittahiti[Music]oh my god i don't know who the sample iswhey is peering throughthe back of his verseit's like the perfect back shotthe disability line is hardexpect like bro if you goti'm not gonna say that's just wow if yourelate to the linethen it's powerful i'm pretty sure hismom was a teacher too so like gave methis ability like i learned from mymother because she taught me that'sthat's just great are we about to get atransition for travis bro can we noti've been through enough the first partof this track is already good enough[Music]bro he hasn't sounded like this sincemaria i'm drunk please don't bro hegonna do this just let me know cause idon't wanna die on camera oh my god thehi-hats in the [ __ ] piano[Music][Music]i'm being jumped i'm getting assaultedright now i'm about to call the cop wellnow i'm better off getting drunk becausethey're going to shoot me that isamazing i tried this girl oh my god thattrack is great oh whoo fair tradewe on a three track run right now iwasn't a huge fan of girls want girls orpoppy's home they weren't bad tracks atall but i could have done without themif i had my say so in the bible love allor somewhat love all and fair trade beenpretty good so far man i'm pretty goodway too sexy is the track of future andyoung thug i really like that trackmainly because of i'm i'm getting himmistaken because i know it's not anorgan but it sounds like just like avibrating synthand it's it appears throughout theentire track even beyond the beattransition you can still hear it in theback of travis's verse i gotta figureout what that is right i don't know mymind is just getting it so confused witha vibrating organ or just like a synththat's just rumbling i don't know butthat [ __ ] being in the back soundsamazing also that vocal sample bothdrake's and travis's flow on that trackwere immaculate[Music]i don't know why he's doing this if thistrack not fire i'm turning out momma[Music]future you don't need to be on this songanyway either because like you got atleast 36 kidsi think the the contrast from the thesample in the beginningis going to make a lot of people believethat this track is just amazing becausefuture does come in with a lot of energythe beat adds such a stark contrast fromfrom from from the intro samplethat it can trick you into thinking thatthis track is just amazing but inreality like nothing much is happeningnot really doing that much for meand especially it coming from drake inin in in in future who are like old andlike fathers at this point it don't hitthe same uh tsu is track number eight orthis is really dark i like this[Music]track is so [ __ ] upi'm i'm hating myself for bumping to itbecause it sounds so good but lyricallyit's like bro you look you are youseeking outparentless women are you saying onlyparentless women work at the strip clubis that what you're saying i know that'snot what he's saying but that was justsuch a weird thing to saylike ohbro likeyou might want to get at her she ain'tgot no mom and dad like that's easymoney i got a drink in the studio and idon't trust me that i'm in this [ __ ]all drake would have to do is put a namebehind this song to be a complete [ __ ]like i i'm not trying to be likethat dude either just make this trackunenjoyable but at the same time it'slike browhy are you saying these things and itjust sounds so passive aggressive likeoh you think you're better now becauseyou you we used to do all this and nowyou're acting like oh you changed likeyou ain't really changed like it seemsreally weird and predatory it feels likelike why is this the way you'readdressingthe person that you used to [ __ ] aroundwith like people change but don't get mewrong this sounds great it does itsounds really good[Music]i'm glad you know cuz last album she wasa baby so basically drake is supportingher glow up while reminding her thathe's the reason for the glow up which tome is just equally as weird but it'sokay i like the melody i like his flowi don't know the song justwhen drake makes tracks like this it'sjust like bro like can you justtell me about a relationship you hadwith a girl that like didn't need yourmoney you know what i mean like make ittell me how to the i mean it wasshort-lived but tell me how therelationship with rihanna was like whatwas that like you know give me a trackwhere the chick wasn't like acting as aslave and performingfor your entertainment for money uhtrack number nine is in too deep featurein future[Music]did he say that [ __ ] was underweight ohhe says so worth the waitbro you 30.now you in too deep and nice you'reechoing it sounds like you're swimmingin the deepest of watersso i like this track sonically isdesigned to fit the lyricismthis isn't a bad song it's just uhout of everything the future and drakehave done together this is probably oneof my least favorites everything almosteverything that they've done even thatone track that came out last year thatthey did i forgot what it was calledlife too good even that track is betterthan this in my opinion this is likebottomdrake in future song ever in that introfrom the beginning that transitions intothis was just unneededlike we could have just got this shortsong and it would have been fine but nolet's make it five minutes and let metalk more about being in a relationshipwith someone who i clearly have far moremoney and power than but i get it that'skind of out of drake's control like he'sgot more money than most people i justdon't get why he thinks it's interestingcontent to rap about track number 10 ispipe down[Music]asking a [ __ ] to see you like chanel iscrazyi just wish you looked at me like youlook at louwho's louthat louie bag it sounds likethe same the sample on uh fancywith drake and swiss beats but it soundslike the regular version of that sampleand i don't know i'm just now realizingthat that version must have been sped upand this must be the normal version ofthat sample tell me if i'm wrong but ilike it it fits this track great writingdown these feelings[Music]you know what this track really needs isa rick ross feature and i know it'simpossible kanye being on this trackwould be great as well i really wishthey didn't have this beef going onbecause they could just be making somegood music together no point in time[Music]i like that track more than every othertrack that drake wrote about this chickor any of the relationship cuts thatdrake wrote about so far this truckmelodically he was there veryreminiscent a little dirk in my opinioni think this would have been a great fitfor little dirk as well um i think drakekills this he carried the track byhimself i was interested in the subjectmatter lines were kind of corny uh itdidn't seem ironic like purposefullyironic uh so it definitely didyou know seem like he was taking himselfseriously here which is a little cringeat the same time when you're talkingabout i was on your ass like back pocketjeans but for the most part the flowshere were good some decent lines uh youknow the world is yours but the city'smine i like that you know so uh this isa dub for drink in my opinion uh tractnumber 11 is yebba's heartbreakfeaturing drake and yabba-dabba-dooi'm so sorry yeah but i did not mean todisrespect your name like thati do too i don't know what i do too buti do[Music]this is what i like to see drake this iswhat i like to see put amazing artistson your [ __ ]don't keep working and recycling withthe same people you've been working withfor i don't know how many years put somenew people in hereoh yes you can baby and that trackeasily could have just had a sample onit too you could have put yellow andsoft on it drake why are youwhy did i say drake and yeah that annoysme i would have liked to hear drake laydown some vocals on that track thoughbecause that that atmosphere that thoseairy vocals that yebba was delivering iwould have loved to hear what drakewould have to say on a record like thatvery misty uh very secluded i like thattrack a lot uh track number 12 is nofriends in the industry this is thetrack that i think drake is going to gocrazy on the titlesays it it says it on its own trackliterally basically says betrayal likei'm expecting lines at everybody lyingspecifically at yay and pusher yeah iknow i hey hey yeah[Music]please no subliminals just be direct gogo at these [ __ ] next i really wantyou guys to reconcilebut if you can't go at these [ __ ] putthem [ __ ] deep six feet some peoplesay they know him as my equalson these [ __ ]okay he's going he's going he's goingkind of crazy right now that that [ __ ]had to spray some disinfectant in therebecause this [ __ ] spitting okay it's apandemic right now yo did i drink on mytahitian tree i didn't i still got someleftuh it's warm and weak as [ __ ] ill idon't know what this vocal inflectionthat he's going with either i don't knowwhere that came from it's like he'stalking as if he's walking away fromsomeone while talking like and andsaying it underneath his breath but youknow how you say something under yourbreath but say it loud enough still forthe person to hear it's almost like youbitching them like oh i don't want tocause a scene but at the same time iwant you to know i think you're a [ __ ]young boyhard that's hard well yay fans i'm a yayfan as well you realize what yay fanswhat they tried to do they tried topaint drake as the bad person for notwanting to meet up with the [ __ ] i'mcompletely on drake's side with that nowe cannot meet you leaked my addie yesit was already public but mad [ __ ]didn't know it was public and you triedto put it out there as if you was likeexposing me you put our messages outthere like [ __ ] i don't [ __ ] with you iwant you to know and he has a he has atrack i don't know if there's no morefriends no no more parties in la nofriends in the industry no more you knowall of this all of it's there all of usthere[Music]all right unfortunately though she didcome in last she did come backohi see what you did therebut she still came in last nightmy back iswait i love how direct he finally was idid i would have preferred you go morelike push it because he definitelyexposed the information but honestlythough it's nothing he could really sayto push at this point like their feud isjust done and i'm sure he could reignitesomething with push but he doesn'tbenefit in any real way going back andforth with push he really doesn't atleast with yay it's like all right we'reon equal footing and i don't like to tryto say it in like a demeaning way topush a t but honestly there's really noloss for pusha t in that you know ifdrake takes a hit it's severe damagethis [ __ ] bleeds out he's done pushtakes a hit he could bounce back fromthat because his core audience is notthe same as drake's core audience a lotof drake's and kanye's fans are likecrossover soa lot of them like if you're a drake fanyou invested if you're a kanye fan youinvested into either album nine timesout of ten you just are even if you sayyou don't like them you still listeningto both of them but yeah i like howdirect he was on on this record i do umno subliminals reallytalked about the things that wererecently going on he he killed that youknow and i like thei don't know it's kind of like a like a80s or a 90s movielate night chase scene track number 13is knife talk with project pat and 21savagepat is killing this oh my god oh my godwhy are you on me like this why are youin my body like thisain't no regular f1that booty clap in line i don't knowabout that one see just like a throwawayand a good portion of these strikesdon't reallyadd to like the theme of the record youknow what i mean likei'm about halfway in a little overhalfway in i'm just kind of seeing thati don't get what about certifiedloverboy makes drake so vastly differentfrom any of the drake that we've seen inthe past like that like this is stillvery reminiscent you know not maybe insound of scorpion it's a lot better interms of song structures in terms ofinteresting content melodiestechnically drake's a little bit betteron this album and a little bit moreinteresting than he was this album isdefinitely less bloated buti just don't see as far as personalityis concerned what this album is doing sovastly different from his previousoutput that he would have to go withthis marketing persona a certified loverboy for the last year year and a halfbecause nothing about this album seemsironic it's all pretty serious tracknumber fourteen is seven a.m on brittlebridal pack um whoa all right i can readdon't move like a poolcould at least keep it a [ __ ] likeanswerdon't be a plutoohgod man why do you do things oh mandon't be a pluto from a non-hispaniccanadian half white half black rapper iscrazy had to pull my [ __ ] out of mudlike i'm training marines i had to pullmy [ __ ] out the mud like i'm trainingmarines it's a hard line i like that getthat address to your driver make it yourdestination instead of just a post outof desperation ahi like it bro i know where you're goingwith it that's that's fire so this meansthat he saw thatpost and decided you know what i'm goingstraightback to the studio i got to add someextra lines to the hype you should havepulled up on me if if you don't post myaddress do something basically what he'ssaying[ __ ] like copenhagen see they'regetting loose with the lines oh so thiswas actually 7 a.m he was just rollinghe's just riding through it started offkind of slow i'm not gonna lie to youbut he wrote thathe did he wrote that track number 15 israce my mind for me[Music]i like this[Music]yeah i like that track more when youjust sing and y'all know i'm a guy thatlikes drake when he's rapping but likeuhi again of a big focus of this album forme was just more like i was just reallyhoping that he was just gonna takethat that irony you know and and kind ofthe joke and just run with it for likethe whole album and just take thosestrengths that he has that people liketo clown him foranddo well with those uh those things thatpeople clown him for on the on theremainder of the recordyou know this is how i think the recordshould just sound in general but we gota bunch of tracks that just go inserious drake mode which sometimes idon't mind but other times it just makeshim look you know corny but here i'mlike okay this is nice and then wetransition into him rapping like crazyfor what like that doesn't add anythingto the track to me the the smoother youknow sappieryou know emotional type drake i mean ilike that uh trade number 16 isfountains featuring tims[Music]i know drake listened to that whiz kidalbum with tim's on it essence oh mygosh he demolished that track[Applause][Music]all i need is tim's on this track brodrake you need to go somewhere bro youdo not want to be on the track with heryou do not that's just bad for you i'mi'm only looking for what she has to say[Music]without drake no offense but you cannotput her on this album and expect tooutshine her this is her sound this iswhat she does don't don't do that uh shecarriedsimple uh trying 17 is get along betterfeature in thai dollar sign[Music]my toes are curling you still calledyourself a lesbian though i'm not goingto forget you know the the atmosphere ofthis track reminds me of avant for somereason vaughn was like crazy at creatinglike the situations sonically and withhis voice he was just crazy at creatingapainting a picture you know what thisdoesn't remind me of a vine you know whoit reminds me of actually is music soulchild that's what this song reminds meof drake is giving me like that early2000s atmospheric energy with songs likethis like this this is what i wanted himto dofor an entire album certified lover boybro why are you rapping there's goodsongs on this album there are but likebrowhat's the point of you being acertified lover boy if drake still peersthrough majority of this [ __ ]oh my godthis is music soul child i'm sorry thisis music soul child all the way thissounds exactly like music soul child youcannot tell me otherwise[Music]he's killing this[Music]i don't know where ty dolla sign was butthat track is one of the best tracksdrake has evermade when it comes to this drake uhsinging [ __ ] this r b drake [ __ ] that'sone of his best tracks oh my god theatmosphere if you don't hear music soulchild on that i don't ever want to speakto you again in my life the progressionof this song the way it builds upi don't get i can't look at this asanything other than an ode to musicsoldier oh my god was that track amazinguh track number 18 is you only livetwice featuring lil wayne oh and rickross probably this maybeokay yeah thanks i thinkthese [ __ ] been actinglike a fetusyou gotta love wayne's punchlines you doum i like this track it's uh typical fordrake to have one of these you know uhi don't want to say posse cuts becauseyou know rick ross is maybach but i feellike you know this is one of those thosecuts one of those one of those jointswhere drake is just like you know alwaysspazzing and whoever the features oursare are going to be spazzing too it'stypical you know i still don't know howthis is a different persona we've seenthis drake a million times already not abad track but it's just i've seen itbefore uh track number 19 i miss you toofeaturing kid cudi um whathow you feel about that though[Music]i do i like kick cuddy i like drakethat's a combo i haven't heardi don't really think ever but thatsounds nice uh too long of a song thoughto me i don't think they needed thatmuch length to get the point across butyeah i like that uh track number 20 is[ __ ] fans don't do thatso this track goes along with theconcept of certified lover boy you knowbeing toxici like that it fits you know what i meanit fits it matches you know it matchesthe tone[Music]i want to say like i want to try to likecall him out but likenever mind i ain't gonna say be so crazybecause it'd be like bro you only watchmy [ __ ] cause you're just waiting for meto say something to make you mad that'sreally it i can do what the [ __ ]i wanna do[Music]you really are you really referencingthis that's that's that's a lot that'sunnecessarily messy though i neverrespected that i not that i have tobecause you know you don't need myapproval to do with the [ __ ] you whenyou're a grown ass man you're 36 but i'mnot going to judge you i'm notbut that's messy bro but that's also oneof the best tracks on that and tracknumber 21 is the remorse okay so you gotremorse for [ __ ] fans i get it brosix minutes of guiltsay sorry god sorry jesus and call it aday even if they make a movie about usthis [ __ ] willokay that was drake's certifiedlover boyhow do i feelabout this album in totality this albumdefinitely washed the taste of scorpionout of my mouth rightum this is a a far more enjoyable listenum while it is similarly bloated uh itdoesn't feel as nearly unnecessary asmajority of scorpion did and when we dopeer into the lover boy persona of drakeis far more enjoyable would thanwhatever would was that b size recordoff a scorpion this is far better rightthat being saiddrakeplayed into this certified lover boypersona for the last year maybe year anda halfthe trailers leading up into this albummade me believe that it would beextremely cinematic very big verygrand in his deliverybut in all honesty this seems likeanotherdrake album where we're getting updateson his lifeuh most recent happenings which i don'tmindbut as he starts off this albumbasically saying i'm about to enter intoa part of me thatinsinuates that there's something todrake that we've never seen or heardbeforefor him to go into the exact parts ofhim that we've literally seen and heardbeforedoesn't really give this album a veryspecial experience it doesn't give thisalbum anyrealnuance when it comes to seeing drake ina new lightand he's still resourceful in that he'llgrab from you know other regions toadd to his own records but in allhonesty it just sounds like he's puttingother people's aesthetic onto his musicwhenever he adds them and tries to existin a lane with them like the tim's trackfor instance um yeba on this album justhad a solo track which i guess seemslike a bit of an interlude that drakedoesn't really contribute toin any capacity and there are othertracks on this album where it just seemslike drake is forcing a piece of his oldselfinto what he claims is a new person orwhat he claims is a piece of himselfthat we haven't seen and for us to havequote unquote never seen this part ofyou beforeyou would think that you would spend allyour time delivering just this piece ofyou but you know we get rapping drake weget drake that takes himself reallyseriously we get drake that's unironic ithought that lesbian bar was reallycorny but i thought it was good in a waythat made me believe that we were goingto get more bars like that that werepurposefully tongue-in-cheek that knewhow corny and stupid they were while atthe same time prioritizing good musicwhile at the same time prioritizing acinematic cohesive experience so itwould have been easy to overlooksomething like that had drake maintainedthis corny lover boy persona and justplayed into it but he doesn't you know idon't know if he's not secure enough todo that for an entire record withoutalso having to let people know i'll comefor your neck too or you know i'll be atyour doorstep or i'm at the top of therap game those are really the onlydimensions that he plays into when wedon't hear this lover boy version ifwe're not hearing about drake in arelationshipthen we're just hearing about drakeas it pertains to his status what i dolove so much about certified loverboy isthat it takes some of the best parts ofdrake and really highlights them andmakes me rememberuh the reason why i got into drake'smusic in the first place which for atime especially earlier in his careershowed that he wasn't afraid to bevulnerable even at the cost or theexpense of coming off as soft but forthe past few albums it's felt like he'shad trouble doing that or as if he'sstruggling to be vulnerable for theentirety of a record vulnerable in a waythat also isn't victimizing to himselfbut vulnerable in a way that just showsthat he's insecure about a bunch of [ __ ]and it's no one's fault but him but hisown i thought he'd be more nuanced ingiving us information about hisrelationships but it definitely appearsas if he's on the same energy that hewas back in 2016where he's basically dangling money infront of his partner's face and takingit away if they don't act right or justtracks where i don't feel like drakegoes hard enough like to track love allwith jay-z great verse from jay-z butwithout jay-z am i listening to thetrack no great first from little baby ongirls want girls but am i listening tothe track without little baby no way toosexy with future and young thug can ireally take this track seriously whenevery person on the track is fathers toat least one to three thousand childrenno in too deep why is it that long knifetalk has some of the most uncharismaticvocal delivery from drake and even 21savage that i've ever heard project pati thought dominated the entire track ithought they could have just let himhave that by himself as an interludefountains with tim's is tim's song 150it just seems like another drake albumwhere this certified lover boy themedoesn't fit into anything really in thegrand scheme of thingsit's just another drake album it's justan album that's better than scorpion i'mtaking away a lot of good songs fromthis though you know shots at yayupdates on his life most recentlybut as it stands nothing new about drakeand we basically have no information onhow he feels about fatherhood i thoughtwe'd get something like that i mean thatcan play into the certified lover boytheme as well but we don't get any infoabout that at all a laugh now criedlater was great wanting needs was greati don't really love what's next but ithad a lot of energy that a good deal ofthis album just didn't have honestlythis just feels like a finished darklane demo tapes all that marketing wasfor nothing that was you wore a heart inyour head for no reason for a yeardefinitely better than scorpion but doesit paint drake in any new lights orperspectives nah not really if anythingit proves the more you age and the moreyou grow your bank account the lessgrowing you actually do these are muchbetter songs but 2018 drake easily couldhave made this album and that's how ifeel about it certified lover boy drakenot badnot amazingthat's how i feel you know pretty coolpretty cool,0
3breWY0OYYg,I thought this golf club was a HUGE GIMMICK but....,296621,6281,71,now as we know most wedges look likethis this is my 56 degree sand wedgeit's got a relatively thin sole it's gotloft it's got a long neck there's ahosel that is what is the industrystandard these dayshowever this thingis definitely not that this is a hybridwedge it's a hollow head constructionit's got a threeinch sole which is supposed to be betterfor not chunking it not thinning it tohopefully get better strikes it has got56 degrees of loss it's the same as asanders i would normally use it's gotthis alignment line down the middle foralignment and accuracy and apparentlybasically it's duff proof it's chopperproof it's hacker prooflet's get onto the green and test it outso this wedge is called june 56 and it'sreally only designed for shots aroundclose to the green it's not for fullerlonger shots and it's not for bunkershots eithernowprice-wise it was 129 from the us and ittook i'll be honest it took a long timeto get over here probably about six toeight weeksit just comes with stock graphite shaftthat says wedge flex and actually quitea nice grip which a little bit thickerthan standard which i'm a big fan of nowyou might know i'm not the best chipperin the world my confidence level at themoment is going up which is a positivebut i'm still subject to a fewduff hits so what i'm intrigued to knowabout this wedge does that eliminate allduff hits and even though it looksunusual or weird or different or sodifferent to tradition can always letthis work oris it just a load of gimmicky crapnow with modern wedge technology you getdifferent grind you get differentbounces which is to help golfers chipbetter effectively stop in the clubdigging into the ground that's this areaof the club has changed a lot on a wedgebut it's a very big difference betweenthe traditional wedge and this bigmonster hybrid wedgeso i know it's hard to tell straightaway but i'm just gonna chip throughwith my normal wedge then chip threewith the the hybrid wedge and just seewhat the difference is i know it's avery basic starting point but it wouldbe interesting to see[Music][Music]it's about typical for my wedge shotslisten i'm like i'm not the greatestwedge player in the world but they'reokay i wouldn't be over the moon withthose but i'm not massively disappointednow with this beastwow i mean first off it's so big thehead size is gigantic i actually quitelike that alignment strip through themiddle another thing i've really noticedeven though this is a hollow head designit's very head heavy it feels like thehead is wanting to always go downtowards the ground because of the weightof itlet's see how it does[Music]well itkind of workedit's not the best result but all ineeded to do then was kind of glide italong the floorthat was really weird it sounded verydifferent as well like it has kind of ahigh-pitched ting off the face[Music]i think i need to get used to this i'mnot sure just at the moment give it alittle bit more speedoh well[Music]because i didn't see a single shot likethat on the advert or the infomercialthat was a little bit chunky that'sreally interesting here that's where istruck the first two from and i mustadmit the last one was a little bit moretowards the toe let me spend just a fewminutes round this green getting a realgrasp of this wedge because thatwasn't the most impressive startso more like a putting stroke that'swhat i've really got to remember on ashot like thisit comes out really strange i've notquite figured that out yet it's easy toget up in the air it really is i'm justfinding it difficult to kind of judgehow it's going to fly how much it'sgoing to spin for example and again forsomebody who's struggling they won'tcare about that but it's something i'mnoticing[Music]hmm can't feel i can get it to the holefrom here let me just try a much longerswing i feel like i canthrow this further than i'm giving itcredit for[Music]getting closer slowly but surelyi am not getting the speed distancecontrolling this at all butin fairness it's one thing to noticebecause i'm just going with a straightface and maybe that alignment line lookhow straight they all are they're allgoing in the right direction just notgetting the right distance[Music]oh i had a chance of getting reallycloseto give a bit of an idea of what thiswedge sounds like as wellbecause of that hollow head designit soundsreallyreally unusualsounds like a woodso far shots around the greensit's doing wellthe positive i've duffedno shots i've thinnedno shotshave they been the best chips i've everhitnoi'm struggling to gauge the distancecontrol to be honest a little bit to dowith the headway the loft the way that ihave to use more like a putting strokebut as i mentioned who this wedge isaimed at they're just they'd bedelighted just to be getting the golfball on the greennow this wedge does have limitations itis only really for chipping and pitchingit's not for bunker play it's not forfull shotsso i want to see what does pitchingactually entail because that can bequite subjective so i'm going to moveback further and further and furtherwith this wedge just to see what itslimits are is it 50 yards can i hit itfrom 70 yards potentiallyit's not perfect it's wedge but i dothink it's a lot positive[Music]yep[Music]that stoppedso quick[Music]oh a little bit thin but[Music]wowthis already has gone further than iexpected tojust out of interest let's just go backto 100 yards[Music]be good[Music]againthey are not good for distance controlnot but i cannot argue with how straightthe shots are going towards targetreally happy with thatso to answer the question is this wedgea gimmick or is it greatit kind of sits somewhere in betweenit's great for really short shots aroundthe green it is almost duff proof and ireally i'm a big fan of that if youabsolutely struggle with chipping it'swell worth consideringi'd also recommend going over somelessons with a coach that's also goodit's not a gimmick but i think becauseof the way it looks and the way it'sbeen marketed it can often be put inthat category going back to that pointif you have horrendous at chip and youhate chippingthis might be the little confidenceboost you need we'll see you next time,0

0cVrM49M9Y4,I Started a Secret Base War,872678,21409,379,so this guy named branzi killed everyoneon the server with a goat[Applause][Music]everyone was just trying to do branzie'snew scavenger hunt but the whole thingwas a sham whenever somebody stopped toread the last clue a redstone trapdoorreleased a screaming goat that killedeveryone that day except me wait asecondis that redstone i accidentally disarmedthe goat trap before i got whacked offthe cliff and branzie wasn't too happy iwill get you wreck one day apparentlythat one day was last week when heposted a video hiding secret bases allaround my base suspicious looking treesecret base weird light shining througha crack in my wall secret base a greyshulker box in my waterfall secret basebut instead of trying to kill him likehe did the whole server i'm one-uppingbranzi and building 10 secrets in hisbase the first one's probably the mostobvious but underneath his chest i'vehidden a button if you press that buttona trap door opens up underneath theladder ramsay's just gonna think this isa prank but if you wait long enough youget access to my underground complex oftunnels in this bunker i've hid all ofmy diamonds because i'm betting thatbranzie won't find any of my secretentrances if he finds even one i willgive him literally all of my diamondsbut i don't think he will entrancenumber two is even better i've hiddensome netherrack in his basement if yousmelt one piece of netherrack in thisspecific furnace it'll open up a secretdoor if it's any other block or anyother furnace it will not open the doorfor the third secret entrance i'mthinking about using a redstone torchkey basically the redstone torch is yourkey if you place it down it should opena door but there's one problem i don'tknow how to build a redstone torch keyi'm guessing it has something to do witha piston though if i place a torch hereit does not power it it's right hereover there oh by the way i'm testingthis outside of his front door so if helogs on i'm kind of screwedwhen i usually do this stuff i spendlike hours agonizing over every singledetail until it finally works those arecats i just spend so much time trying toget it work but like is this seriouslyi really thought that was gonna work butnow come on open up yes that worked ijust need to add some delayokay so this circuit should add all ofthe delay we need add some of thefinishing details place the torch hereit does that uh-huh we drop straightdown and we're in oh my gosh it actuallyworked it's been a pretty good 24 hoursi actually haven't played too muchminecraft but i got two new doors toshow you guys you wouldn't see it if youweren't looking for it but i put a noteblock amongst all of the dirt and if youpress it it does open up a secret door imean look how cool that is plus it'slike the best worksafe you just pressthe button swim out you're out of hisface the fifth one's also pretty coolsome of you might like it better thanthe water one it's probably like secondplace for me but if you take any item inyour inventory and you're like i gottaburn something chuck it literally in thefire a piston door opens up down hereboom we're in the secret complex and igotta mention something in a strangetwist of events somebody else isactually trying to make secret entrancesin branzie's base i don't know what cameacross the server maybe everybody wasjust got an itch to build secret basesbut my friend siv he's going aroundbuilding secrets all over the server andhe wants to make one here too so we'regonna team up but first i wanted to makesure none of my secrets were too easy tofind so i invited him over to see if hefound him give it aquick ender parole here i'm wondering ifit might be like out here underwater orsomethinghe has found one i don't know what itopens he doesn't knowwhat's going on i don't know oh oh wallgotchait took him like 15 minutes to find thefirst door so i was pretty confident wecould move on we built another secretbase about a hundred blocks away so wecould connect it to mine i built atunnel out of brick and granite and bamwe had our sixth secret entrance here wego okay okay i'm just leaving it we'regoing we're going we're going we'regoing we're going i'm not gonna be fastenoughyesoh that's awesome awesome yes but waytoo easy thankfully civ has agreed to doa fake collab with ramsay so that whilesiv is keeping branzy busy i'm gonna bebuilding a secret base right under theirfeet should increase the difficulty justa little bit more umthis might go horriblyi'm pretty sure i'm at branzy's base buti have an invisibility potion on me sowe should be able to make this work getreadyinvis invis invis invistake it off okay okay[Music]i wonder how it's going the idea i gavesim is so dumb wellthey should be plenty far away i don'tthink no there's no way they'll comeafter a bit of finagling and thanks tosib's glorious distraction i got apiston door in place don't lookdon't look branzy don't look don't lookoh we got it okay secret entranceaccomplished this is good this is goodthis is very good honestly it was prettyeasy sip distracted him he was like 50blocks away but that might have boostedmy confidence a little too much thistime i wanted to build an entrance wheni'm literally under branza hey maybethis isn't the smartest of playsoh my goshohoh my gosh he walked straight through methat was the scariest one whenever okayokay i'm burning i'm burning i'm buryingdid he hear anythingdid he just load a crossbowdoes he hear mewhy does he have a firework loaded inthereoh my gosh he totally knows me he knowsthat he knowshe knows oh my goshhe loaded a freaking crossbow guyswhat is brands brands he's gonna kill meif he sees me i feel like he's up therewith a crossbowabout to shoot me i heard him again[Music]at this point i was totally convincedfranzi was just walking above mecrouching waiting to shoot me with afirework but i had a plan i used a modcalled replay mod to get all of my timelapses and in it i could see if ramsaywas above me what is he doing i havethis in fast forward mode he's justsneaking around with a freakingcrossbowwhat is he doing he's on top of thetower you know what if he's on top ofthe tower i feel safe coming outdid you see me[Music]he's therehe looks like he's looking at me isuccessfully made a secret entrance butthen my invisibility ran out and phantomspawned above no no no my humanvisibility's running out oh no thephantoms were gonna be a dead giveawayso i went back to the main base andtried to get inside my secret complexwhat okay go go go while the noise wasmade while the noise was madenowhy's there got a big creeper inside mysecret bunkeris the world exploding or it's just methat was a little close for comfort butwe still need one more secret entrancethankfully branzy logged off and theidea for this last secret entrance isthat if you stand on this pressure platefor say like five or eight seconds it'llopen up a door i'm gonna have to addsome sort of timer but like nobody'sjust gonna stand here right to make thisdoor work i kind of had to modify hisbasement i added this row of stairs herethat way we have room to add someredstone i don't think he'll notice sothis block should be where the pressureplate is nowhow do we do this maybe with hoppersso that doesn't workyolook at this redstone it looks socomplicated but it works my only problemnow is whenever you step on the pressureplate you get this tick tick tick tickhear that that's not what i want to hearespecially if we're trying to be likesneaky i have a theory i don't know ifit's gonna work but it makes soundbecause the dispenser is empty at somepoint in theory if i fill that up withlike wooden swords i mean i hope it'llworki don't necessarily think it will i'vebeen staring at like this flashingredstone as crude as it is i think itworks so now i need to hook up a door orsome sort of entrance you know what whydon't we just put it right behind thetrap doors can we fit a piston door inhere ummight be a little tight i don't know howmany of you do redstone but when you putsomething together like this and itlooks like a mess but it works that'slike the best feeling in the world idon't think i'm gonna get that feelingfrom here because i don't really trustthat mess of redstone but we'll try itanyways so if i just stand herein theory we should hear some pistons inlike three secondsnookay so i can't get too hyped right nowso if we just walk over itand then like we walk over it again thatshould not activate this door right herewhich it did not open again do iti feel like a wizard the last secretentrance is done but you should knowthat when bransi finished all of hisentrances he asked for a tour of my basewhich meant that i ended up walking pastall of his secrets like look how closethis is the shulker box is right therei'm like a block away i want to do thesame thing to branzie but he's going tobe real suspicious if i say hey can yougive me a tour of your base no no nowhat better way to throw him off than tobuild a secret base with him all rightjust dumping the rest of my stuff in mychests about to go lodge my friend'sface you

3N5QX6VI9VA,"ADAM COLE On His AEW ALL OUT 2021 DEBUT, MAKING HIS DECISION & MORE!",224956,6856,114,like it was a surprise that you became afree agent and it sounds like it was asurprise toeven the company that made melet you gocan you please explain that processbecause that had to be a roller coasterthat maybe you were expecting but not sosoonyeah so um funny enough uhbelieve it or not i was also surprisedyeah um i was under the impression thatit was uh like six months later um so itwas a surprise to me it was a surpriseto themumand then all of a sudden i went fromthinking okay uh you know december iswhat i'm gonna start talking about a newcontract uh and then it was like oh nowe're talking about it in three daysum so then i know it was it was publicknowledge to a lot of peoplethat i had uh signed a little extensioni was in the middle of a really seriousangle with kyle o'reilly which was veryimportant to me he's one of my bestfriends in the entire world um and thenafter that is when stuff kind of openedup for me so but yeah very surprising tome it was just as surprising to me whatwent through your head decision making imean like you've probably twisted andturned in different directions you havea lot of different things you probablythought about yeah absolutely umwell because when you think about wherei was like that technically was my dreamsince i was nine years oldand then i'd seen everything that aewwas doing i've been here countless timesto support brit and hang out with thecrew and it's just the best crewthe shows are amazing the fans areamazing but at the same time i hadreally built a reputation for myselfthere as wellbut i knewin my heart pretty early onthat i wanted to come hereand it was no knock whatsoever on them ihad a veryexcellent four-year experience but i iwanted to come back and work with a crewwho i love being around 24 7.a crew that is just as passionate aboutpro wrestling as i am and fans that feelthe exact same way that we do soum making the decision was a fairly easyoneadam you made a huge statement tonightwhat is the message that you're hopingthe pro wrestling community receivesfrom tonight uh i hope they've realizedthat i'm just getting started uh like inthis sense i know i've been i've beendoing this now for 13 and a half yearsbut i'm only 32 so so i have a lot oftime left in my wrestling careeras excited as i am this is a whole newchallenge like when i look at thisroster i see so many guys that i'venever wrestled before i see a whole crewof fans who are ready and excited forthese awesome matchesi'm ready to show them that i'm going todeliver in every sense of the word i'mgoing to deliver and more importantly iam so excited to do so thank you so itwas reported before you left wwe you hada talk with vince mcmahon uh how didthat go and how different is it talkingto vinceas i was talking to tony yeahuh the talk went great um we had areally really good conversationabout a lot of different things but butthe actual conversation itself uh wasawesome i i had no bad experience withhim whatsoever umhe he is an intimidating man thatdefinitely commands respect in a lot ofways um but but the experience itselfwas totally fine umworking and being around or even i meanbecause i just started tonight but beingaround uh tony isso cool for so many different reasonsbut the the biggest one is howcontagious his love for wrestling islike i knowi know that i love pro wrestling but youcan't help but be more excited and moreready to go and more fired up whenyou're around tony i i feel like i cango and talk to tony about anything whichwhich is such a at any time in the nightfrom now on anytime they're shining yougive me any timewhich is which is so cool so uh yeahyeah it'sand i'm not just saying this becausehe's sitting here i say this toeverybody but but tony is an amazingamazing person something uh tony adam uhquestion was the plan always for you toget here and be on the show right awayor was this something this this all cametogether really quickly and uh veryquickly i mean like in the time hedidn't know he was gonna be out ofcontract and we had no idea and i had noidea he was gonna be out of contract andthen all of a sudden he was out ofcontract very recently and a lot ofthings came together and it was just anamazing time i mean so many great thingshappening for aew and for our businessbut i i really can't imagine a bettertime or a better person to come and behere for such an amazing night and itmeant a lot that you did so thank youthank you uh adam you talked about beingin the business for like 13 years andobviously you had a 13 and a half yeahbut um anyways you talked to the justfrom the past company and the otherpromotions you've been with in on theindependence scene uh something aaw'sdone is a lot like flex your creativemuscles a little bit more and when itcomes to things um talk about whatyou're kind of looking forward to doingthat not that you were limited or didn'thave any confines of certain things butmaybe opening up with uh some creativeaspects a little bit maybe that youweren't able to do in the past yeah soso this is really broad but just havingthe option of having conversations aboutdifferent ideas like uh knowing that umyou know me and tony or me and matt andnick and me and whoever can sit in aroom and have a bunch of different ideasand maybe one sticks maybe one doesn'tbut knowing that that line ofcommunication is completely open uhnaturally i think a lot of times withcreativity people are afraid to saysomething because they don't want tosound stupid or they don't want to lookstupid and that doesn't exist here soagain even if you have three horribleideas maybe that'll inspire an excellentidea or someone else will come up with adifferent different thought so that isthe part i'm really excited about cool ithink i overheard you say that yourfamily was texting you and they were soexcited what does this mean to yourfamily i mean not just be with brett butto be here in aew because i think yousaid your mom was texting you she wasreally excited yeah my mom and mybrother my mom is the only person thati've uh responded to so farum and that's not it's not because umi'm choosing to not but because it'sjust been so crazy uh but she lives inpennsylvania and my younger brotherlives in pennsylvania uh and theywouldn't miss this for the world and idon't know if i should be saying this uhbut part of why brit is so amazing isbrit was the one who made sure that theygot here oh wowwhich is really i have to give hercredit for it i have touh she was the one who made sure theygot here uh they have they've been atshows of mineuh for years now like literally since ifirst started my mom hasalways been someone who supported thisthrough and through i remember shealways said she goes as long as i seethat you're passionate and as long as isee that you're progressing i willalways support you and she loved likeagain her nine-year-old son being likemom i want to be a pro wrestler she okayhoneybut she she's been there for so manyhuge momentsand uh she texted me and said i've neverseen anything like this beforewhich is huge she's been toprobably a hundred of my matches she wasso happy all capital lettersum but it's it just makes the moment somuch better like like all of my favoritemomentsin this job is when my family gets to behere as well because they're such a hugehuge support system so it was amazing soamazing that they got to be hereum you have you just came here and youchose to side with the elitewhat people are you gonna face next oh idon't know so there's a bunch ofdifferent options but there aredefinitely some people i'm lookingforward to stepping into the ring withnumber oneis the gentleman that i kicked tonightthat's jungle boyhe is aincredibly talented young man with ahuge future and a guy would love to kickin the face againbut oh my gosh when you think of darbyallenmjfcm punkum got christian cageso many different options so manydifferent choices uh really i can'tthink of anyone on this roster who iwouldn't look forward to facing exceptfor the elite adam what do you make ofthatthat sequence from the time you gotthere to the end when when danielson andcage are walking out where would yourate that among your bigger momentsi think it's my favorite uh moment ofall time seriously that's what he saidwhen he came back he said that he didn'tthat nobody you guys weren't here that'swhat he said yeah yeah and and i've hada lot of different uh really coolspecial i'm so thankful for moments butthis onewas just so special on so many differentlevels like the umthe the idea and i really do this everytime but anytime i'm a surprise anywherei always tell myself i'm like god i hopethey're excited like i hope they're ihope they're happy uh that i'm here soagain aew is a is a company that i'vewatched from the very beginning i've gotto see it up close and personal lots oftimes with brit umand i can honestly say i i again this issomething else i shouldn't be sayingbut i was so excited that when i waswalking my legs were shakingand again i've been doing this for for along time and it wasn't nervesit i was so excited that my body wasjust it couldn't help but move as i wastrying to walk as cool as possible butyeahummanit's it's one of the highlights of mylife for sure i'll never forget this thepiggybacking off saying that you've beenpaying attention to aw the entire timeuh you're the first major name from nxtto really make this jump here what youdon't think 2.0 or major names oh wellyou put that with david garcia it's thegreatest thing in the worldbut uh so in hindsight having been onthe other side of that wednesday nightaffair therewhat did you learn during that processseeing the company from afar and how didthat have an influence on your decisionyeah well so it was it was alwaysexciting to watch aew because you alwaysfelt like you didn't know what was gonnahappenuh which tonight was the epitome of thatbut like i i loved that feeling and thatsense of at any moment something thatyou did not see coming something insanecould happen on the show week to weekyou just didn't know um for mepersonally as far as the um thewednesday night back and forth i'vealways been someone who just kind offocused myself on what i was doing um sobut at the same time and what i mean bythat was uh not looking at it as um howcanwe be better than aew it was more howcan i make uh my segment or the my promoor my match as good as humanly possibleand then let's see what happens but asfar as watching the show from afarbetween the in-ring wrestling betweenthe promo work between the storytellingand again between the chaotic what isgoing to happen that's what was soappealing to me adam do you see yourselfin any other talent here in awlike you you reflect to yourselfdo i see anyone else joining aew no nodo you see yourselfyou know watching another of the talentson the greeceoh oh who might look the in aew yes yesoh okay remembers yourself you know along way ago yeah yeah so umagain jungle boy is a guy that i thinkof umi'veso enjoyed mjf and his growth and hisdevelopment um he's always been anexcellent interview and then to see himmold himself into an even better in-ringperformer has been incredibleand againdarby allen is a guy i've really beenwatching because uh beforeuh darby allen came to aew i had thechance to wrestle darby one time um andnow to see his development and hisgrowth has been awesome to watch so he'sanother one that i definitely have myeyes on last question please lastquestioni think we have one more yes after thiswell i'll ask one more question i thinkif anybody has one more good one adamcan you uh walk us through your mindsetwhen you knew that the plan was going tobe rejoining the elite on this showyeah umgod again most of it was just pureexcitement like the the older i'vegotten i've been better about enjoyingthe things that happened instead of youknow before i was so focused on everysingle step and you know how i was gonnaget into the ring and you still do thosethings but it's more subconscious now iknew tonight was gonna be so special forso many different reasons that i toldmyself i'm like you have to just enjoyenjoy it you have to just enjoy itof course i was still shaking and soexcited out there but i didall i was worried about all i wasfocused on was making sure that i neverforget this night and i never willthank you so much wait is it one morewhat is it what is it one more okaythank you for everything sure uh i'm i'mpersonally for me i'm most excited aboutyou being here thanks man thank youthank you number two how does it feel togo home knowing that you're still ableto play video gamesyeah it's incredibly important to me umtwitch was something that i started kindof over the pandemic it was something iwanted to do for a long time but ididn't really take the time to teachmyself and then when that happened and ihad a bunch of time on my hands i waslike okayit's uh no choice now there's no excusei have to do itand initially i literally did do it justbecause i really like video games ithink anyone who knows me knows that i'mreally passionate about that but thenwhat started from the twitch stream wasthis community of people that would allcome together and literally share thatpassion over video games but i havegotten so many messagesof people who are going through a reallyreally rough time and the only thingthat they look forward to at that timewere those streams i've built aconnection with a lot of these people iknow a lot of them by nameit social media can be a really nastyplace sometimes okay and there is noneof that that exists uh in the twitchstream so i i adore doing that i'm sohappy that i'm still doing it uhand yeah i i don't plan on stoppinganytime soon so of course i would liketo uhto as he exits i'd just like to say astatement which is that uh you know thewednesday night war is over and we wentuh in the demo i believe out of 75episodes we went74-1in the demohe is the one in 74-1 when there was awednesday night war this is the man whoused to strike fear into my hearts everywednesday strike i used to be scaredthis guy scared the out of me everywednesday and there's nobody i'd ratherhave here and it means the world thatyou came thank you all thanksthank you so muchthank you thanks everybody,0
XJlY7O0X0L8,Qualifying Highlights  2021 Dutch Grand Prix,3304392,81058,930,"Perez is in trouble here as Esteban Ocon,
next across the line, goes sixth fastest.Nicholas Latifi goes fifth fastest.Now, Lando Norris needs to get out of
that bottom five, and he does.But only just for Lando Norris,
and Sergio Perez is out of qualifying.Sebastian Vettel was trying
to weave his way through,and that is two Haases
that have got in his way.- ""That was close.
That was terrible.""That's a penalty coming Mazepin's way.
Of no consolation to Sebastian Vettel,who's down there, in the bottom five,
out of qualifying,on a fast lap, whilst others
were trying to build a gap.- ""We're out, Checo.""
- ""OK. ******* brilliant!They were so slow with these guys
on the pit lane.""- A disappointing start to the weekend for him
after a pretty, pretty tough weekend in Spa.- Nikita Mazepin is out of qualifying.
That incident involving him and Sebastian Vettelis going to be investigated after the session.
Schumacher's out as well.- Head down.
Oooh! And he's...I was going to say he's very aggressive
on the way in, and he was.- Too aggressive on the way in,
and all the anticipation that was buildingin that Williams garage...
George Russell is out of qualifying.If you're not pushing, you're not trying,
and he was definitely trying,and he was definitely pushing.- He's on the limit. It's going to happen
at some point. Do you know what I mean?You can't have a perfect
qualifying session every race.Ooh! Touched the grass!
- Oooh! That's another Williams!And that is a bigger impact,
and that's Nicholas Latifivery much out of qualifying,
and that is another red flag.- ""Are you OK? Are you OK? Are you OK?""
- ""Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.""- He's out of qualifying, as is Yuki Tsunoda,
Lando Norris, Lance Stroll, and George Russell,because the session
will not be resumed.- We've seen with Max when the car's
a little bit twitchyhe is super fast, and I think
we're going to see that right now.- No Dutch driver has ever started higher
than 14th for a Dutch Grand Prix.Max Verstappen in the 1:08s
and that has delighted the Dutch crowd here.He was a couple of tenths up on both Valtteri Bottas
and Lewis Hamilton through the first sector.He was two tenths up on Valtteri Bottas
through the middle sector.He was a tenth up on this man, Lewis Hamilton,
through the middle sector,Pushing, Max Verstappen, and maybe pushing
Mercedes to places they just can't go here,because Valtteri Bottas
finishes three tenths behind Verstappen,as we watch Hamilton coming off
the banking and the final corner.Is he the man that can deny Verstappen pole?
Not on this evidence.He's three and a bit tenths off Verstappen,
and he's behind his team-mate, Valtteri Bottas.Verstappen starts his final flying lap.Valtteri Bottas, Lewis Hamilton,
Daniel Ricciardo are the threethat haven't started their flying lap
as yet.Hamilton might get caught by Leclerc
going through the final corner,as Verstappen continues on his way
and takes that high line around the banking at Turn 3.A slingshot on the exit out towards Turn 4,
and a nice, fast-flowing esses section,as we can watch Lewis Hamilton
going around the banking.Leclerc finishes his lap.
Goes fourth fastest.Hamilton gets to the line
with about eight seconds to spare.So it's going to be
right down to the last gaspsfor Verstappen to see if he's got pole here.
And he's going to have to be waitinga long time for the Mercedes
to cross the line.Chequered flag is out,
as Pierre Gasly goes fourth fastest.Retakes that position on the second row.
That is a super performance from him.Ferrari fifth and sixth.
Esteban Ocon goes seventh fastest.Verstappen's going quicker
through that middle sector.Roar of approval from the fans
as they see that one.And they rise to acclaim Max Verstappen here,
as Giovinazzi goes seventh fastest.And that's a super qualifying performance
from him.Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton
seem to be the only two that can deny Max Verstappen,who might yet go quicker
than his provisional pole time.Guess what? He does!
Verstappen's on pole here in Zandvoort.There's the Mercedes of Bottas and Hamilton,who can try and deny him
his first pole position in his home Grand Prix.Now on the banking
we go with Valtteri Bottas,who knows what it's like in the Junior Formula
to have success here.But at the moment Bottas can only make
second place on the grid.Can Hamilton deny Max Verstappen?

(Friday Night Funkin)",1783044,115093,1545,[Music][Music]well that escalated quickly[Music]hello internet welcome to game theorythe show that's here to spit rhymes andsolve mysteries and we're all out ofrhymes first a quick note as we getstarted today this week starts mycampaign to try and be named as a guesthost on jeopardy full details are overon this week's film theory i'll link toit right here but the long and short ofit is that i really want to host thisthing it's been a childhood dream ofmine to just you know stand up on thatstage for like one episode and if peoplelike dr oz can host this thing then whynot an edutainment youtuber like myselfor any of the other actual ed youtubersthat are here on the platform i think adigital creator deserves their chance tostep behind that podium and show theworld what they got get this industry abit more respect and you know what giveme a chance to actually live out achildhood dream that helped inspire thecreation of these channels anyway if youthink a youtuber like me deserves theirshot well i need you to sign thepetition below it's linked in thedescription i need about 300 000signatures at minimum because that'swhat it took for levar burton to gettapped for five episodes so if we have ashot we need to crush those numbers sothank you guys so much for your helpfingers crossed that something happensor you know what if not just gives usmore opportunity to complain about howtraditional media just doesn't get itthank you so much now on with today'sepisode and i know what you're thinkinganother friday night funken theorydidn't you already do two of these andthe game isn't even in its full statebut before you turn away this isn't thetheory that you might think it is thisis actually about something far biggersomething far more sinister than fridaynight funkin see today we're looking ata massive arg mystery that came out ofthe friday night funkin mod community incase you're not familiar game mod is anytime someone's been able to manipulatethe game's code to change how it behavesand looks sometimes even creatingentirely new stories and gameplay modesand to be honest some of the world'sbiggest games actually started off asmods the incredibly difficult kaizomario series mods of super mario worldboth league of legends and dota havetheir origins in a mod for blizzard'sgame warcraft 3 even pubg and dayzstarted their lives as mods of the armaseries if you've ever bothered to watchme over on the gt live channel you'llknow that i love playing fan games andmods because to me that's just where youget some of the most creative excitingideas coming from new game designers whoare still learning their craft but itend not to cover them here because wellthey're fan made the lore isn't canonand their quality can really vary wildlybut today is the exception becausethere's one mod of friday night funkinthat uh it went a bit off the railscreating not just a few good songs toextend the life of this game but a fullyblown lore of its own hidden behindlayers of coded messages spanning acrossall corners of the internet it is scaryit's mysterious and it is mad loyaltheorists it's time we talk aboutliterally every fniff mod ever versusbob week yes that is the actual fulltitle of this thing earlier this yearthe mod was everywhere i think part ofthe reason it gained so much attentionis because it's actually designed as aparody of other friday night funk andmods crudely drawn characters clunkycrass dialogue oh and memes all thememes there's a fart sound effect buttonbecause it's so lol random we go upagainst the little man whose bonus songis nearly eight minutes straight ofbreaking glass bras a dancing hey ohthere's pizza here meme and spotify adswanna break from the ads if you tap nowyou'll receive 30 minutes of ad-freemusic there's even a character named ronwho is literally a dancing meme folderhis song when cranked up to 1.75 speedby the way is my favorite to come out ofanything friday night funk and relatednot gonna lie thing is a bop this is acertifiedbut the real star of this two-part modis bob a basic black and white animatedcharacter who boyfriend compares todream and i gotta admit it's notentirely wrong i could definitely seethe family resemblance anyway the moduses the same basic progression thatyou'd expect from a friday night funkmod boyfriend is introduced to a newchallenger each song becomes slightlyharder tap arrows to win except bob is alittle bit different sure after you beathim the first time he becomes a littlemad bro but if you beat him again thingsgo insane bob becomes consumed by hisanger and transforms into a black blobwith photorealistic eyes teleportinghimself boyfriend and girlfriend to whatcan only be assumed as some sort ofhellscape or at least that's what weassume the devs apparently couldn'tafford to pay for the cutscene thatshows us that part at this point there'sa huge spike in difficulty as the gamejust becomes one big creepypasta bob'seyes flash across the screen youstruggle through and if you manage tomake it to the end of the song it justkinda ends fortunately for us thoughthere's a part two a few months afterpart one's released the bob mott gotitself a sequel titled bob's onslaughtwhere bob shows us that he suddenly hascontrol over the game he makes parts ofthe ui disappear elements spin around hemoves the game window adds open upblocking the player's view and throughit all the notes come at an inhuman ratethis thing is crazy and if you somehowmanage to beat this insanely difficultchallenge the screen goes black bobclaims that he has no more tricks foryou here but then things glitch andreveal a google drive link and thisfriends is where it gets real weird nowthis part of the game seems to have beenmainly overlooked on youtube in favor ofthe fast and nearly impossible gameplaybut you know me who am i to ignore somerandom link given to me by a stranger ifollowed the link and boy oh boy thingsgo way way deeper than you first thoughtso what's really going on with the bobmod let's find out when we jump into thedrive we find a slew of documents imagesand sound files for us to investigatethe drive appears to be owned by someonecalled lennon noah and by searchingthrough the files we start to get asense of who this guy really is lookingat the file of noah family expenses welearned that this is a family of threefather lenin wife jess daughter janeanother file titled dear lennon startsto reveal to us that the family is introuble jess has fears that her husbandis starting to grow distant from thefamily we learn from another filelenin's writings that the day after theletter was written jess and lennon areon the rocks she doesn't believe himabout something but what well by jumpingback and forth between all the differentfiles we can actually assemble atimeline of events a few days after jessand lennon's fight we see that lenin hasbeen blocked from spending familyfinances after buying a book called howto clean carpets which was prompted froma quote liquid accident at work the nextday he's fired from his job as evidencedby the pink slip that's found in thefolder and it's here where we just startto get an idea of what lenin's been upto quote look man i don't know what thisweird goop in your office is but youcan't do this on company grounds youbarely do work and you're always toobusy with your ai side projects to doany work lenin also mentions a lot ofthese same things in his writings on thesame day quote again these experimentshave to work i've done so much with thisgoo it has to work this ai i've createdi love him so much he is so smart i haveto bring him to our realm he will bebeautifulan ai mysterious goo coming to our realmladies and gentlemen we've got ourselvesan aftonloyal theorists we've done this danceenough times to know that this is notgoing to end well lennon is clearlytrying to bring his ai bob to life usingsome sort of organic goo the picturelabeled unknown inside the filepractically confirms this for us as wesee in the black goo the letters b-o-bso is that it all done case closedfriends oh no this is just the beginningthere's still four files left a soundfile called plant a picture file anddocument called jane's drawing and janeand finally a picture calledyou get the point and it's here thatthings start to change from a littlestore easter egg to one of the mostcreative fully blown args that i'vecovered on the channel let's start withaudiophile plants and if you haveheadphones you might want to turn thevolume down very briefly i just want togive you a taste of what this thingsounds like because it's pretty unusualbut also a bit sharp and piercingsounds like it could be morse code rightor maybe plugging it into a spectrogramwill give us an image we've done both ofthose methods solving mysteries in thepast but nope not this time neither ofthose will actually result in anythingthis is actually something that's alittle bit more complicated the giveawayof what this is are those high-pitchedbeepings that happen at a regularoccurrence they're indicative ofsomething called a slow scan televisionsignal basically a way to send andreceive pictures via radio waves if yousee a spectrogram that looks a littlesomething like this with a header thatsounds different that's used tocalibrate the signal and then a repeatedseries of pulses that are used tosynchronize the signal you know thatyou're likely dealing with an sstv feedso let's just listen to the audio filebriefly one last time so you can hearthat header and also identify thosesynchronizing pulsespretty cool right okay we're nowofficially done with obnoxious audiofiles so you can set your headphonesback to normal now in the early days ofspace exploration sstv was actually usedto transmit images of the far side ofthe moon nowadays it's not really usedthat much since you know you can justsend an email attachment and i gotta sayhonestly in all my lore hunting and argsolving it's the first time that i'veever really encountered this method ofclue solving so really awesome job theredevelopers a plus for creativity justreally stellar how do you solve thissort of thing luckily there are onlineconverters converting it we get thefollowing picture next up is the dddfile which is much simpler just asquashed image of a url that's missing afew letters which leads to a websitethat seems like it's all about the memesbut actually contains another piece ofinformation using the classic techniqueof upping the contrast levels we findthat down in the bottom right it saysjust noah's page dot card dot co whichcontains a link to an audio file calleddispatch this one isn't ear splittinglike plant was so here's a clip that youcan listen toyou can hear a robotic voice reading outa long string of unrelated words this isactually a code written in what's calledthe nato alphabet a alpha b bravo ccharlie etc it's a type of spellingalphabet basically as a way to spellsomething over audio only signalswithout the letters getting confusedwith each other since you know a lot ofthem sound alike the result gives youthis absolutely glorious phrase edmukshiehyou know what i'm just gonna put it uphere on the screen because it's a bunchof gobbledygook clearly there is morehere that needs to be solved so what isit base64 is it a substitution ciphermaybe a visionaire cipher for feelingspicy nope again none of the usualsuspects work i i told you this was areally creative really wild mystery iwas stumped until i looked at the otherclues that were left in the folder oneof the last things that we haven'ttalked about is the file jane andhonestly there's a reason why it's justthe daughter's homework assignment andlet's just say it's not gonna get agrade worthy of hanging up on therefrigerator throughout the page we seejane making a bunch of misspellingssaying that she's learning the alphabetnotably leaving off the last letter ofher practice alphabets the z on thefirst and the a on the second somethingtells me that teacher is going to haveto break out the red pen when gradingthis one but teacher matpat's here andready to give her an a plus because allof those missing letters andmisspellings are a whole lot of arg redflags the only question is what do theymean well jane says that her favoritegame is foursquare with a hyphen andthat is our biggest clue of all you seethere's a type of puzzle called a foursquare cipher that involves four squaresof letters ideally arranged in a grid offive by five the eagle eyed among youmay have already worked out that a fiveby five grid works out to 25 letters butthere are 26 letters in the alphabet andthis is when you realize that's whyjane's alphabet leaves a letter out ofeach one which means it's time to makethe squares the forward alphabet will goin the upper right hand corner and thebackwards cipher will actually go intothe bottom left in the other two blockswe'll use a standard alphabet with i andj combined which is a traditional way tosolve these sorts of puzzles and yeah wehave ourselves a giant grid of lettersnow what well now it's time for thathandy phrase from earlier where we'regonna use it like coordinate pointstaking each two-letter section to findpoints in our new grid as an example westart with the letters e and d to decodethis we actually need to find the e inour first cipher text box in the topright and d in our second cipher textbox in the bottom left now we see wherethose two overlap in our plain alphabetsto get the letter c we do this again inthe lower alphabet block to get theletter z this makes the first part ofthe deciphered text bcz mu becomescx becomes cc and so on and so on and soon until we end up with something thatbarely looks better than what we startedwith notice the repeated word capitaland the equals at the end well if wetake the capitals and turn the letterafter it into a capital letter and theequals at the end into an equal sign weget something that looks closer to thisnow it is finally in base 64 which meansthere's one last step to decoding it butyou also have to lose that x at the endbecause it was just a placeholder tomake sure that the text worked outproperly anyway blah blah blah there's alot of smaller details here long storyshort you eventually wind up with apaste bin link that leads you to anothergoogle drive this one is ominouslytitled case file and it finally gives usthe information we needed to have acomplete picture of everything thathappened from reading the files welearned that the black goo wasn't enoughto bring bob back to life he needed ahost so lennon pulled in norman osborneand tested it on himself when thatwasn't enough he took his wife and childwith the sole purpose of sacrificingthem to bob as confirmed by thecharacter profile file however thatdocument also reveals something else afew days later his daughter jane wasfound covered in black goo heavilydisfigured and in a coma but still aliveapparently she wasn't fit to be the hostfor bob and she escaped but jess andlennon remain missing and that's wherethe story ends there's still some cluesthat don't have places like the sstvsignal image doesn't really connect toanything and a symbol's image thatappears in the folder entitled evidencebut weirdly this does seem to be the endof the story and then of course as i waswriting the script something new wasadded to the mystery the developersasked for it to stop now clearly visiblein the original google drive folder is asubfolder labeled arg spoilers thedevelopers go over all the story detailsand then clearly state lenin has nothingto do with the canon of bob mod or fniffsorry for the weird arg see according tothe developers the arg started assomething small just some inside jokesin the source code of the game that ledhim to think that they could make a fullarg soon they had accomplished exactlywhat they wanted but in their wordsquote it eventually started to grow inpopularity and started taking a toll onthe arg dev's mental state i just wantedto get this thing to a close so i canput my mind at ease as someone who'sworked on multiple args in the past ican totally understand this things veryeasily get out of hand very quickly buti still want to do this episode to bringthis whole thing to light because thiswas without exaggeration one of the mostclever arg experiences i've yet seenonline it also answered a lot ofquestions regarding the sinister natureof the bob mod which i thought wasreally cool even if it doesn't wind upbeing official canon and lastly thisnote made me think maybe things aren'tquite done with bob you see they saythat the arg has nothing to do withbob's in-game lore but there is stillone thing i haven't covered if you beatthe first bob mod on hard mode you'regiven a web address bob is mad this pagegives you some clues to find a secondwebsite and then another and another andanother you end up at a site where ittells you that bob is happy you get hereseems sweet but a problem occurs if youkeep digging there's a hexadecimal codeat the bottom of the page and decodingit leads you to yet another webpagewhere bob states what how you hear i amangry if you keep going by solvingbinary morse and base64 codes bob getsmadder and madder until he gets coveredin goo and disappears leaving themessage you do realize what you've donethe devs learned that bob doesn't likepeople looking into his origins and whenthey do he disappears to claim thatperson as his next victim so in someweird way the arg being called over mayactually just be another part of the argi don't really think it is but from astory perspective there's truly no wayto canonically end this arg without itfeeling like an actual legit part of thelore because the arg and finding outabout bob's past is just part of thatprocess kind of like a weird catch-22scenario anyway bob clearly likesattention he wants people to play withhim but he doesn't want those people tolook into his backstory and when they dohe hops over to his new host and so nowhere we are talking about him is that agood thing are we making him happy or ami talking about his past are we makinghim mad anyway the whole thing's overnow and it wasn't cannon anyway so itreally shouldn't[Music][Music]i'd like to thank everyone for comingtoday matt was a fathera husband a friend he'll truly

i jumped in did a 360 andonly took three hearts i like it up herebetter still walling here it's tough iwant it at least to look a little bitnatural but i guess it's gonna be alittle tough to make it look naturalwith such a sheer carve right there i'lldo my best this ain't my first wall it'sdefinitely not done but it's got a shapeand i think a door could go perfectly inthe middle and i think i might flex myredstone knowledge and make a pistondoor totally easy didn't struggle in theslightest he didn't tell me what he wasdoing and i didn't ask so i made myselfbusy oh look a house well you did helpkeep the phantoms off my back at nightand now we've got a piston door oh whatbut with that piston door now the wallisn't really a wall anymore becausemonsters can run through it so today iinstalled a lock it didn't take verylong i've built one of these beforethere's even an emergency button so ifyou end up locked out you can get inwith the press of a button luke waspretty proud to show me what he made buti don't have the heart to tell him thati'll never use it it's pretty likelythat even i won't use this door all thatoften we really don't leave the town whyleave there's so much to do and thistrader's about to sell me some beats andthere's still a lot more wall work itlooks fantastic but skeletons stillspawn on top i'm not able to show therest of this clip for fear of it beingdemonetized but i want you to know thatthis skeleton died a painful and verygruesome death this this is a wall goodjob honey you know i live to serve youso uh we're done with the walls now ifit is your will we've had quite a lot oflag walking around town and i think iknow what the problem may be well idon't know any problem that can't besolved with multiple explosions babablack sheep have you any wool no sir nosir i've been murdered so now the lag isfixed and we've got a nice new holefilled with sheep for our next projectit's gonna be an auto sheep farm shouldprovide plenty of profits but not muchlag i built one of these in the superflat video put one in my creative housethis is not my first time you gottaremember it's been a long time sincetours and i played on this world both ofour minecraft skill has gone upsupremely even though today tors was afkin the town and some zombies attackedher i took control of her charactersaved her she's lucky she has me day 112a trader showed up but he didn't haveanything good so i ordered my bodyguardto kill him then it was back to profitsand beautification for both of us imoved the auto smelter today was just ina bad spot had to make room for thisthing which we totally have a plan for imean it after putting our heads togethera little bit day 113 we present to you av thanks oh it's a vault all right avault for you we started on some officesmine is quite cozy i still didn't knowwhat building i was in apparently heywhy does your office have a cauldronyours doesn't about done here and lavatrap day 114 i fix torz's bow i keeptelling her that mending is the way andi keep telling him to mind his ownbusiness other than that i'm still hardat work on the sheep farm i think 10should be enough and day 115 i got the10th sheep in it's done well it's notdone but the depressing part's done i'llbe changing our town's entire sheepinfrastructure by the time this is overand this shepherd will definitely haveto go rest in peace sheep i didn't knowhe would go this far on a happier noteit's just me on day 116 cause lukewasn't recording surprise surprise andtoday i was cleaning up after my husbandas always but later when i was admiringmy cats i was attacked by a horde ofzombies luckily i was able to escape tothe bank vault the vault bank whateverit is it came in handy day 117 i found avillager hiding underneath ourfloorboards and evicted him with lavayou haven't seen what i've been doingfor a day and that's probably a goodthing because it's quite the mess i'mtrying to get the auto sheep farm tooutput wool to our storage room i'vedone this before in creative but neverlike this well that sounds boring let'ssee what tors is doing i'm on adangerous quest for the only things thatreally matter in life cats and flowersso i found a few but none were new gotattacked and lost a cat on to the nextvillage time to pillage took me the restof the day to get back this is what iget for rhyming i've been living insideof the walls for like three days now andright as i got the whole system workingthe game crashed that was prettydisheartening but didn't take too muchmore time to fix now i'm expanding thestorage honestly this is all a veryinefficient way to keep storage buteventually we want to make a whole newhouse entirely so for now we can go withthis and i'm not sure how this happenedbut today one of the villagers gotinfected he's got lights his door isshut beats me well one positive for allof this is now we have a curedweaponsmith that'll sell us some nicedeals and with the auto sheep farm doneand tons of money on the way i'm workingon a new project i'm making a reallygood axe for taurus she has to euthanizeso many cats she needs a good onemeanwhile i was making my own presentfor luke dominique but this this wasjust for fun day 121 i'm going back tothe villager breeder for more atrocitiesi'm trying to get a shepherd to buy bothwhite and black wool for maximum profitpotential got em didn't take too longthat's a pretty common trade had moretime in the day so dug this menacinglooking pit for villager infection mostof the inner workings will beunderground towards would never let mebuild something this ugly meanwhile iwas wrapping up some loose ends at ourfirst house i could talk about what i'mdoing today but it's honestly prettyboring and you probably wouldn't beinterested good thing i was doingsomething interesting what a great dayto exist so i decided to collect myfirst cat from the cauldron this [ __ ]straight from hell i see i've come backtoo early next time i'll send a chatfirst don't worry i was productive thatday just had to wait till night to workon the breeder luke's doing veryimportant things but boring things wantto come on an adventure with me ofcourse i'm looking for flowers andfelines but first i need fish at first ithought the day would include more thanjust fishing but once i got started onsnuffing out their tiny little lives ifound it hard to stopsomething about the ease of putting themdown with one single swing was just sosatisfying so anyway where'd the day goi made my way back home hey she used thedoor my door i'm still deep undergroundworking on the villager infector buthopefully this should be the last day ofconstruction and right here's thefinished output tunnel when a villagergets infected i can put it right back inthe breeder of course i'm still on theroad looking for cats really townsbecause that's where the cats are when icame back luke claimed he was catchingzombies this can't be good for thevillagers horrible for the villagers butgreat for our prophets here i'minfecting a shepherd that buys black andwhite wolf thor's watched the wholething she's an accomplice i was neverhere i saw nothing i swear kind of weirdhow i have some footage of you curingthe villager yeah cured after youinfected them no matter what gets set incourt i'm gonna be in the infector for afew days this is a long process don'twant anything to despawn on my adventurei found a prairie town with greatpotential and i'll clean up anything forcats a barn on top of a leather workerinside of a mountain this will doand i never thought i'd say this butthere's a lot of monsters i need a walli'm still working on boringinfrastructure day 127 but taurus wasn'trecording so this is what you got towatch sorry anyway i got a shepherdtoday he'll buy black and white wool forone emerald each and with the auto woolfarm that's a lot of money you know idon't know what happened to the otherguy he probably just left on his owngetting the shepherd in there i had tohit him several times so now the priceis at two but it'll come back down andthis is only the beginning with thatvillager infector i'm gonna make somereal changes around here villager tradesespecially infected ones are pretty opyou get tons of emeralds and experiencepoints for better gear i also worked ona new light design today things keepspawning and it's just annoying yeah ihad to stay in town for the profits so ifixed up a lot of things we've beenneglecting and tours was doing finethanks for asking now that money'sreally starting to roll in we can affordlanterns and i can get rid of thesebirthday candles you can always tellsomeone's starting to get rich when theyeat golden carrots torza's axe is comingalong good too efficiency fiveunbreaking three and mending but there'sstill more to do it needs sharpness fivelike i said she kills a lot of cats andi don't want him to feel pain but atthis point i just need levels to makethe act so i worked on maintaining thesheep farm it's the backbone of oureconomy finally a cat i don't have tokill let me add him to the collection ithink i'm up to eight now uh anothernight sleeping without tours i wonder ifshe misses me what a great day time tocuddle with my new cat i hope luke isdoing good i miss taurus but she's faraway in her cat town so if she's gonnavisit she's gotta do it by force afterdoing the journey to the cat town myselfi don't really blame her anymore it'sabout 1500 blocks through some denseterrain though eventually you do hit aprairie and then you can't miss it wow alot of zombies here you could really usea wall hellotoys you're herei'm here hello oh luke's gonna be sosurprised and i can't wait for him tomeet snowball huh luke's gone that's notvery notable of him guess it's time forme to become a crazy cat lady once irealized she wasn't here i set up theportal and got to digging 1500 blocks inthe nether really doesn't take that longwhen we finally reunited she gave me aflower aren't i lucky bright and earlythe next morning i went to work on a newportal the first one i made was prettysloppy she's really not too far foranother portal this should only takeabout a day until i realize that i'm offby like two blocks the quick fix is astaircase but my girl deserves betterdamn right i'm the tours with this newnether highway now i can visit my wifeon her quest for more cats which makesme happy though we may have to figureout something here she tried to bring acat home and broke the whole auto sheepfarm seems like a flaw in your design mycats are perfect oh and meet my newspade david spade and when i finally gotto my cat town i had found a banks heonly cost two fish easy to please he'shome he's named he's official and luke'salready taking out the rest justembezzled some cobblestone time to builda wall luke would be so proud of me wheni heard torrez was building a wall irushed over as fast as i could withlanterns i just had to see it just soyou know i'm very proud of you she's gota lot of land out here when the wall'sdone it's gonna be pretty awesome timefor more profit villagers i need moneytoday i'm making a stone cutter and soonwe'll be able to turn rocks intoemeralds add this to the wool profit andmaybe it won't take a whole month tomake a perfect axe you feeling okay downthere a little shaky or somethingyou need some waternow that he's done every piece of smoothstone that we produce makes one emeraldoh yeah our enchanting ability is aboutto take off please don't talk to yourfamily it'll only make the separationharder i had to take most of day 138just setting up tracks to get him inhe's pretty far from the breeder severalcats were harmed in the process don'ttell tours at least he went in willinglyi didn't have to hit him once it's gonnacost me 39 levels but finally towardshis axe is done the axe is so powerfulit actually can't be renamed i got aflower in return for it fair deal hit mebabe hit me hard spunk huh i thoughtthat would do a little more [ __ ] okayyou've used the axe it definitely worksnow i gotta healit's safe to say she likes the axe buti'm gonna leave before she kills me idid a lot day 140 and started bykidnapping a farmer the dividends arealready insane with the villagers i havebut the farmer will just add to him andthe whole point of this was to make someinsanely op gear with all of the xp thati get from the traits here i'm makingtours a new pickaxe then i let theinfection set in the virus has beengreat for my profits while the workingclass suffers i've only gotten richernext i go to space that farmer's lookinggood it's almost time to stop thetorture farmers buy pumpkins forinsanely good prices so i'm gonna put anauto pumpkin farm below his hut it won'tbe too big but it doesn't need to be ifi'm working with a cured farmer cat townconstruction is going well rent's aboutto go up way up sir this is a gatedcommunity we do not allow the undeadhere i'm still working on my autopumpkin farm built underground to looknice and avoid taxes it works i'vealready made one pumpkin but i've got toget them up to the surface it shouldn'ttake too long i've got a lot better atredstone since my creative video andafter a very productive day i found theperfect spot to watch the sunset if onlyluke were here well taurus forgot torecord for the next few days so it lookslike you're gonna be watching me make apumpkin farm i should say a pumpkindelivery system the farm's complete thisis just where the pumpkins will spit outpumpkins are made underground shot up tothe surface and sold right in the samespot oh yeah it's real ugly but that'swhy it lives in the basement like yourmom i'm trying to make it as pretty aspossible there will be no industrialvibes in our town i keep thinking howgreat it would be to have some melons icould literally double my profit downhere but hey at least i got everythingworking today even if it does lookpretty ugly well buddy it's sad to seeyou go but i have to say i feel almostnothing doing this i want to point outtechnically i didn't murder him hecaught on fire and then burned to deathwhich was not my fault welcome homejebediah you feel a ghostly presence yousay i'm sure it's nothing every pumpkinthat's produced makes one emerald and ifi ever get melons that's even more plusgolden carrots just a great upgrade youknow for now i think i'm done onmoney-making methods i'm already prettyrich and i think i need new armor andwith all my money villagers and xp itdidn't take very long to get some niceprotection mending diamond armor later ichecked on tours at the cat town iwanted to see how she was doing shefinally found a spot for us both tosleep in the cat town which made me feela lot more at home get out villager thisis our land now i thought we should gowith a loft bed design keeps the floorplant open and keeps villagers fromsleeping in our bed we had to move alittle bit of roof but working togetherthis didn't take too long so comfortablemy neck gets twisted in all the rightways we didn't get to sleep in the loftbed the first night but i think that'ssolid construction a job well donebright and early day 147 i had taurustest out my new protection armor andthen i had a great idea well half of agreat idea there's absolutely nothing onthis side of town and i'm putting downsome netherrack foundation asplaceholders we still have no ideawhat's going to go here but getting ridof that netherrax is going to be goodmotivation to think of an idea wow honeyit's really ugly this is motivating ihate it i was just farming day 148 whentaurus viciously attacked me i had myreasons later i made a map not a big onebut who doesn't love maps it's nice butyou can really see those netherrackboxes we gotta think of something quicktaurus feels very similarly i think wehave an idea for at least something togo over by the netherrack boxes acartographer the town's got a hut forevery single type of villager except acartographer i can't believe we didn'tthink of this before you're just soinsignificant and useless you didn'teven cross our minds and with some lightphysical violence the town is completewe've got one of every villager oh thetown will never be complete we'reimmortal on this world i guaranteeeventually you'll see tours 1000 days soas the town becomes more final i'm doinga little bit more work on finalizingthose roads oh no a sick villager andthere's no doctor i'm sort of a doctor iwalked her through making a potion fromstart to finish because every girl lovesto be mansplained well i guess theinfected villager died time to do what ido best kill cats you may not believethis but on day 151 i'm tearing downsome wall of course it was for newbetter wall gotta protect those bees nowyou may have seen this structure atcertain points during this video andwe're wondering what it was it's theobservatory it was built during those 10days or so that we lost forever andtonight we're burning it downi have a bit of a history with fire soi'm just going to sit this one out andobserve yesburnthe observatory was mostly my ideaanyway so it's probably fair thattorah's just got to watch and honestlyyou don't really need an observatory theview from up here is already prettynotable of course some things cannotburn so day 152 was spent cleaning upthe last little bits i worked on moreroads today they're actually starting tolook decent meanwhile i went on anadventure and found some flowers and gotlala lost don't get me wrong i had a mapi just got lost in the flowers well torshas been gone for three minutes time tostart ripping out the walls we're indesperate need of some sort of disposalsystem we have tons of trash and i builtone today of course i mansplained it totours when she got home and that nightwe got a woodland explorer map from thecartographer for a new adventuretogether it's probably gonna take awhile to get there but we're hoping tofind a jungle on the way for some junglewood and melons we tried to stay asclose as possible but as you can seethis terrain was pretty rough even so iwasted no opportunity to show off infront of my wife cool though once nighthit we met a hilly forest and somehowgot separated tours would like me toinform you that she doesn't want to talkabout what happens next so i'll do thehonor like i said we got separated andin that commotion tours forgot to eatand in the forest she was surprised by awitch who poisoned her now the poisonwouldn't kill her she was left on half aheart but a skeleton a skeleton mightwhen it happened i was nowhere near likei said we got totally lost and i lookeduntil morning for items but they werejust gone so day 155 is about a weekreal time from the incident and tourswill not be joining us for a few days idon't blame her she was real upset aboutlosing that axe i gave her and davidspade i knew she'd respawn in ourbedroom in town so i put a little chestin there and filled it with some gooditems for when she returned i have aplan that'll surely get her to come backi'm gonna go to the end i'm gonna behonest she never really liked the endanyway so this is probably our bestopportunity to get the loot oh she'dcome back no matter what but with someelytras that'd be even better you mayhave seen my video of surviving 100 daysin the end so it's safe to say i'm anexpert now and after bridging over tothe outer end islands i'm ready to findme some loot i very quickly found onesmall end city and conquered it almostimmediately i've done this without armorweapons or even tools so when you'refully kitted it's really nothing hardall of day 158 i found no elytras butplenty of shulkers so at least there'sthat after a few days of nothing i wentback to the end island and decided touse one of the end gateways reallyshould have started with that itteleported me right to an end city withan elytra like i said before i'm heckastrong so it didn't take too long to getthe good stuff i am also hecka smart andbrought rockets so i was able to getanother nearby elytra actually i gotthree elytras i don't even need thatmany just lucky i think mostconveniently when i flew back to theportal and jumped in i was teleportedright back home i then put mending onthe elytras made some shulker boxes andeven replaced towards his fishing rodand soon this rainy day of not playingwith tours will end i can't wait wellthanks i died again borrowed one of yourlives get well soon that doesn't evenmake sense at least his heart was in theright place well back to the grind iguess oh hey i missed you i missed theaxe you gave me and so will the cats soi wasn't recording for this but ismacked the heck out of binks and had toheal him day 161 most of the day i justfollowed around tours i hope she doesn'tmind i just missed her it had been solong since we slept in a bed together itwas just all around a good day and ijust got a really good idea but i'mgonna have to facilitate some breedingfirst don't mind me i'll just be in thecorner here watching i've also gottareplace this cartographer taurus killedthe first one cause he sold us the mapjustice yeah i think this one's a littlebetter anyway he sells item frames whichis always convenient sorry i didn't domuch i'm still figuring out what to dowith my life day 163 the netherrack isbeing removed i've got an idea while iworked on the frame of this new buildingtours worked on the facade of the wallyeah i'm just doing my best to make itlook as pretty as i can luke had theidea to build a library here and i loveit it felt great to finally putsomething in this area and when we'redone i think the village will be more orless complete ah no minecraft build isever complete but at least the villagewon't have any dead space in the libraryof course we'll have a bunch of reallyawesome librarians with some reallygreat enchantments and this one has silktouch so maybe in the future if one ofus ever dies and loses all our items wecan replace them very quickly for therecord i do not appreciate this shadeone bit so now begins the incrediblyriveting process of trying to get thebest enchantments i got two of them intoday but one isn't working and theother only sells one enchantment so imight have to cleanse these guys but igot one that sells infinity tors isgonna like that using these librarians iwas able to make a replacement bow fortor she lost it when she died and she'sbeen sad ever since wow thank you somuch you're so sweet and kind andhandsome and with every new day i getbetter and better librarians for betterand better enchantments the first one iput in there still refuses to work butsoon unemployment will run out and thenhe'll die this whole town is becomingquite the machine to produce some of thebest gear in minecraft and it's reallygonna help us in the future gotta havegood gear with all these cats offsettingmy efficiency no i didn't touch any ofthe cats today why would you say that ifanyone's wondering how i'm doing i'vejust been mining it's what i do after idie today i'm farming up some dark oaktrees we got some saplings fromwandering trader but weren't recordingit took all day because i did itsustainably but you gotta love that darkoak by the end of the day i had enoughsaplings for a permanent dark oak treeand it was a big and must have been along day tours and binks were waitingfor me in bed it's day 169 so i gaveluke some sugar and i gave tore somemilk i decided to follow her into themine today see what she was up to ihelped my pickaxe has silk touch so ican fill in her holes nicely i alsohelped her deal with a little bit oflava you know how she feels about thatstuff all in all it was a great day 169we went to bed early and day 170 all idid was look at luke what a great day itwas a great day lots of profits and i'mfinally getting pretty close tofinishing out the librarians howeverbefore bed i stopped for a littleinterior decorating i'm not sure howlong these corn flowers have beensitting on the ground yeah that looks alittle nicer i don't think tours evennoticed more librarianing is that even aword well anyway that's what i'm doingday 171 got one to sell me efficiencyfor so now i can make awesome tools i'malmost done but my progress is slowingdown it can take quite a bit of money toget these guys upgraded and i don't evenknow what day it is where did this gowhat happened and then luke wasn'trecording so now we're all on tour'stime and here's luke now with gifts oh ifeel so loved tours is thorny timsterrific now luke you can show yourselfout i have to mine i made sure the otherlibrarians were watching when i took outthis one for being lazy other than thati did some trim work around the farm wedeleted i have no idea when we got ridof this i have none of the footage ijust don't know things can happen whenyou go on tours time todayis a good day this villager right herehe's going to sell me sharpness 5 whichmeans now i can finally remake taurez'sperfect axe and this time i even got toname it then i put it in a nice littlepackage i was so glad she was going toget it back back from the mine oh what'sthis open it towards this terribletomahawk thanks hey how you liking thatnew axe just need a test funk if youreally want to test bonk hit me naked ithink i can take it wow hon that's areal strong x there you better becareful with that thing it was in thatmoment she realized how strong she hadbecome no longer would she live underhis thumb no now it will be taur's timeall the time thank you taurus it was anhonor to be killed by you being ontour's time really messed us up thelibrary is now done and i started on abasement down here i'm gonna put a cozyenchanting room a one-stop shop for allyour enchanting needs though i did getdistracted by all of the awesome gear wecan make now new armor and tools forboth of us the library's done butconstruction left quite a mess so i'mgoing to be cleaning that up on day 177.i'm also going to be changing the doorsfrom oak to dark oak i think they justlook nicer really not sure when thishappened but now there's a witch wherethe weaponsmith should be i'll fix itlater for now we'll just try not to goin there i've been working on so muchindustry i didn't have any time to makeanything look pretty so i did a lot ofthat today and when i came home my bighappy family was already in bed waitingfor me again i spent another daybeautifying adding lanterns instead oftorches for a premium feel i did a lotof little things on top of the wellthere were torches and i've been meaningto slab it for forever and did it todayi also watched tours make some profits iwas just excited to see her use thelibrary luke said we would be fightingthe wither soon so i'm just gettingprepared oh yeah you can definitely tellby the amount of milk in my inventorywe'll be fighting the wither well firstwe'll have to take out some witherskeletons and somehow i convinced taurusto come with me no no no no you'recoming with me all right today's the dayhere's three fire potions just to besafe the way there is incredibly crudethis is something we'll have to fix inthe future i think this is fine luke haslittle faith in me today we took it slowkilled skeletons together she'd neverdone it before it's really not that hardthis game is for children we took on abunch of skeletons day 181 but of coursegot no skulls it's pretty rare even withour looting three swords however we keptat it and i got the first of the threeskulls on day 182. luke put on the skulland i hit him then back to nothing onday 183 but you're gonna have some drydays when you're going for witherskeletons day 184 i got mobbed by threeof them and came very close to dying ididn't tors is the only thing that cankill me on this playthrough more nothingday 185 but as you can see i'm clearingout this area for spawning more witherskeletons we can use this in the futureday 186 i got the second skull and ididn't even realize it and on the verynext day i got the last skull aren't ilucky what's crazy is i built a wholerail system and killed twice the witherskeletons but she got more skulls thanme now that we're back and there isn'tmuch time left we should focus on somemore important builds like bees this isone of the original villager farms andit's always been a little ugly so ithink we can get rid of it oh yeah demoday is the best day we went with asimple design little more open concept ithink the bees will be happier here imade so many bee babies i just couldn'thelp myself no my children hmm we'regonna have to figure something out herethis is a problem i put in somecampfires that should keep the bees fromstinging us plus a touch of acacia woodthese bees are looking snazzy day 190i'm still working on projects that willgo hand in hand with our success todayi'm renovating the fountain hey taurusdo you think this looks too evil oh goodfor now we can change it when we getjungle wood right that's a good ideathat night we got gunpowder the hard wayit was awful i don't know what he'stalking about i have so much moregunpowder than him yeah looking back myfootage is pretty reckless it's nosurprise she got more inside of theenchanting room i'm trying to slaptogether an auto sugar cane farm to makepaper i guarantee it won't produce anymeaningful profits in this video but itwill be useful yeah it's not my bestwork but i did say i was slapping thisbad boy together and i still have tocomplete my catalogue so i hit the highseas no new cats but i killed tons ofcreeperssugarcane farm is fine i broke it offcamera but now it's working again allright taurus today's the day you'relearning to fly i don't wanna the flyingis actually pretty clean even thoughwe're on multiplayer because we'replaying on a land world the only othertime we flew together was on the notablecraft server and that was just terriblelike a baby bird flung from my nest ibroke my neck luke says i used too manyrockets but i killed most of thecreepers so he can shove it in othernews we finally got melon seeds thankstraitor that i definitely killed rightafter this now that taurus can fly it'sadventure time we're mostly looking fora place to fight the wither and cats ofcourse there's a lot of stuff we haven'tdone in this play through jungles oceanmonuments there's tons we could still dospeaking of

iQuiaWysdsI,Building a 5 Acre Pond! (Hurricane Update),370869,18603,176,folks at home welcome back to the fiveacre pond build and if you missed theprevious videos in this series i'll puta link down in the description below andlast week we added a variety ofdifferent structures to the pondincluding tunnels and different types ofbrush piles that would attract bait fishand some that would provide shade and wehad already gotten the pea gravel setaround the island and the oak throne setin place and one of the last things weneeded was a good water source so we duga well so we made a lot of progress overthe past 10 weeks with this pond butunfortunately we won't have a lot ofproduction this week because we'regetting a lot of rain from hurricane idanow its path is directly at new orleansand you can see this is where we are onthe map so we're supposed to get severalinches of rain so before all of thatcomes i needed to get some erosioncontrol in place so i went out and gotsome silt fencing and got that alltrenched in especially in thosewatershed areas where i know we're goingto get a lot of water flowing into thepond and also got these things calledhay wattles that'll help slow that waterflow down and then i went through andreseeded some areas that didn't havegrass and covered those up with hay soat this point i've done all i can do toprotect the pond and we got to leave therest up to mother nature so a lot of youguys wanted to see a time lapse of thepond filling up with water so let'swatch some of this footage as the rainstarts rolling in and this is where i'mkind of torn obviously after you justbuilt a pond you definitely want to fillit up that way you can move on tostocking it with fish and all the othergood things that come with a body ofwater but the reason i'm on the fenceabout it is because i had a couple ofother projects i wanted to do before thepond filled up one of them i had my guyready to come in and build the dock butif this storm fills it up we're gonnahave to go with the floating dock versusyour traditional style wooden dock andthen there were also a couple of othersmall projects that i wanted to do likewelding the wire cage onto the verticalstand pipe right over the drain valve soif i ever opened up the valve to drainit our bass and bait fish wouldn't getsucked out of the pond but at this pointthere's nothing i can do so i'm justgoing to sit back and accept whateverhappensnow we're on the east side of thishurricane so we're going to get a lot ofthe rain but it also comes through inbandsso we got one band today that's comingthrough and then another tomorrow soover the course of two days they'reprojecting six to eight inches at ourcurrent locationso the heaviest rainfall today waspredicted to come through right beforedark and last all the way up untilmidnight and i'll be interested to seehow this camera picks that nighttimerainfall up because it does have nightvision on it but man that is some heavyrain and we are starting to get floodingin our area and unfortunately it doesn'tlook like the night vision is going todo us any good whenever it's rainingthis much so we're gonna have to waitand see how it looks in the morningall right folks time for a pond updatei'm out here in the middle of ahurricane i'm just in between bands it'snot over but we did get a good break inthe rain so all that straw i put downgot washed out so no big deal on thatlooks like these did hold up pretty goodit did wash out a little spot rightthere and let some water through gotmore watercoming back here you can see some ofthat grass started to take before therain came in but that right there iswhat i wanted it to dostop a lot of that from getting washedright down in thereoh the silk fence definitely held upstopped a lot of silt from gettingwashed down in there sothat was well worth itbut it looks like most of the waterhas ran down there to the deep end let'stake a walk around the pond and check itall out here's an area where we had alittle bit of erosion and some silk gotdown in the pond you can see most of thebanks holding up really good everywherewe got good grass but anywhere there'sjust one little strip of not so goodgrassthat's where it washes down in andwashes that silt right into the pond butso far everything's holding up prettygood just one little spot like this hereand therehey we finally got grass growing onalcatraz island i like itso i'm really happy with this spot thisis where all the water washes into thepond right here and you can see where itwas starting to erode right before ithit our little protected areas righthere it was rushing in got here silkfence stopped it and really nothing madeit to the other side so i'm definitelyhappy with that i was worried about thisarea but the fence held upthis didn't get washed out too badbecause all that grass there sothankfully the damage report is prettyminor todayand all of this straw actually held upand you can see the grass starting topoke through itall right this deepest wood pile isalmost under water right now and it'snot floating it doesn't look like so itlooks like the bricks are holding itdowngot the bottom layer of the tunnel isbasically submerged you can pretty muchmake a cast out hereabout got the bottom of it full but thisis just the first band second band'ssupposed to be a lot worse i think i'mgonna ride it outover there in the little shed and try todocument some of thiswe'll see how bad it getsall right now we're rolling on throughthe second day and the second band ofstorms and while we've gotten some heavyshowers it's pretty crazy because justto the east of us and just to the westof us are getting hit really hardand you can see here on the radar mapour pond has actually been right inbetween two bands for most of this stormwe did get a tornado warning thismorning but luckily that passed with noproblems but i really hope all thosepeople in new orleans are okay becausewe're hundreds of miles away from thisstorm and it's gotten pretty bad attimes i can't imagine what it's like tobe right there in the eye of the stormall right folks the calm after the stormthe road's finally dried up enough forme to get back in here we definitely didnot fill up which is probably a goodthing and a bad thing you can see we'vegot about three feet of water back therein the deepest partthat bottom layer of tunnels is justunderwaterdrain valve completely submerged but allof this pretty much drained down intothat deep end so the good part of all ofthis is we're building the pier rightthere so all of that is still dry so wecan still go in with that typical docksetup that you see on most ponds and nothave to use that floating dock so eventhough the hurricane missed us for themost part we got a lot of heavy rain onthat second day those outer bands cameback through and hit us and caused someerosion in some places so having thisfence set up definitely helped and keptit from getting way out of hand but youcan see there's some spots like thatright there that definitely need to befixed so i'm gonna go back in fill thesein with dirt reseed them and hopefullywe don't get another big major stormthis year and here's a quick overheadviewall right folks got some wooden signsmade that i'm pretty excited about let'scheck them out first up we got clyde'scove had to have one for bonnie andclydenext upthe oak throne 150 year old oak treethat fell over look at the detail inthat artwork that's pretty coolhad to get one made for alcatraz islandman that looks goodand last but not least bonnie's by youwith the bass symbol there man i'mreally excited about the way thoseturned out we use that game of thronesfont on the oak throne and in thatfamous alcatraz island font so herehopefully soon as soon as the pond fillsup when you look out across here you'renot going to see anything but water fromhere all the way across so what i wantto do is put like for instance that oakthrone sign i want to have it stickingup above the water level so when you'reout here fishing or even just standingon the bank you always know where thatoak throne is now the alcatraz islandthat's gonna be the only one that wouldnaturally be out of the water but heyyou gotta mark the island and thenclyde's cove sign will be over there andi haven't even shown you guys wherebonnie's bayou is all right clyde's coveis just over there right around thatbend and this is gonna be bonnie's bayouso the idea behind this area is just ashallow little pocket with a lot ofstumps in it one of those that you'dreally love throwing a topwater lure inso i got a bunch of that gnarly lookingstuff kind of resembles root ball systemlike the oak throne but we're going toput it all through out hereand actually that's the emergencyspillway over there let's go check itout so once the water gets a foot and ahalf above that standpipe level it'llstart flowing right out of thisemergency spillway and we were supposedto come in and finish it this week butthe trucks couldn't get in here with allthe roads torn up so he's bringing inthis rock mesh system that we're goingto lay out right hereand it's going to go down and bendaround and go back down there to thecreek and the main thing you want to dois not havethat water go wash back behind your damso he built it up right here a littlefunnel or tunnel right down theresending it towards the creek so thespillway and the dock will be in nextweek's video i'm liking the feel ofbonnie's bayoutopwater heaven i got those few piecesset outum i got one more big piece up there inthat wood pile that it's gonna take thetractor to bring it in hereall right i think i'm gonna leave itupside down just like i did with the oaktree makes these guys look small now soi got it anchored down with some cinderblocksgot the bonnie's bayou sign moved overto here surprisinglythis big stump has stayed upright and itlooks like some silt or something washedin maybe out of this clay and helpedbury those cinder blocks a little bit sothat may actually stay standing allright now bonnie's by you as a wrap timeto move on to the next project[Music][Music]all right folks got the oak throne signset i think it's a perfect match for thebig oak throne i may have to get alittle bit longer extension on iti got it good and secured in there rightnow but i think that may be a littleunder the water level so probably gottaget go a little bit higher with that oneso let's talk about how we're gonna findeverything once it fills up with waterso we're gonna have the oak throne signhere we're always gonna know wherethat's at but all these other wood pilesyou're not gonna know where they're atonce it fills up with water so somepeople talked about using gpscoordinates to mark them that's a goodidea but i got one that i think is alittle bit better i'm gonna go in on allthose wood piles and mark them withbuoys so i'm gonna cut a lot of thisstring off and just leave just enoughfor the buoy to get up to the surfacelevel because if you put too much stringon there it may float over here orwhichever way the wind's blowing but inthis case i'll put about six feet ofstring on that log right there and thenas it fills up it'll always mark my spotfor me so we're going to do it to allthe major piles one wood pile there woodpile there the tunnels another wood pilethere and then one on the back side ofthat island and what you know it everywood pile is underwater we're about toget a little wet all right i'm out herewith that bullseye structure just gotthis one tied onbut just as a reference to how deep itis i'm out here pass knee-deepand we still have a lot of water levelto go you can see we still probably gotaboutfive to six feet so it's a big drop offright here so you got the road bed rightthere five foot drop off and thenanother road bed right here so this is anice little hole now my only concern iskeeping that floating and not gettingcaught up in all this trash and notbeing able to float soi tossed it over there hopefully it'llstayout of the wood pilegot that wood pile marked i'm just goingto leave that buoy laying up here on thebankthis water actually feels really goodstill a little muddy from the storm butit's nice and coolit's about 90 out here todayall right i just tied off to that secondrow of tunnels there the bottom threeare all underwaterhope there's no gator in therethe shade shack was definitely theeasiest of all tied it off right therebut the cement did harden before allthat rain came in so all the posts aredoing goodall right trough is done this is stillone of my favorite ideas because i knowthe bait are gonna love this spot righthereall right folks out here on alcatrazisland giving you an update soit seems to be one of the hot spots forall the wild game and animals we gotdeer that pile through down there everynight some snake looking pattern therebut if you guys remember last week ifound a squirrel tail up here so i'mgonna point my night vision camera atthis island we're gonna see all of thatanimal activity and try to figure outwho's the hunter out here using alcatrazisland as its stalking ground so thefirst thing we see is a big group ofdeer and that really doesn't surprise mebecause we have so many deer around thisproperty but it is really good to seethem using the pond as a watering holebut what i'm really interested to see isthat coyote or bobcat or fox that's beenattacking the squirrels around herebecause we've seen a lot of themso after watching hours of nighttimefootage i finally found it and check itout they're on the island right nowand you are not going to believe what itisit's a whodowl who would have everthought that owls would be attacking thesquirrels but that's who's using theislandman that's crazyall right folks one of the first thingswe promised sarah is that once we gotwater in the pond she could go swimmingin it so we're gonna let her get dirtyand muddy and then we're gonna wash heroff in the tub so are you gonna get inthat pondyou gonna swim in itso one of the projects for next week iswe got to get power over there toalcatraz island and what i think youwould typically do is run a power cableunderground and pop up over there at theisland but in our case we can't dig intoour clay blanket so i was thinking aboutpvc well pvc may not mold with thecontours as well so i'm thinking aboutgoing in with that flex conduit stillrunning the marine grade cable throughit but then maybe putting the flexconduit on the bottom and then coveringit up with some of that pea gravel tokeep it right there in place and theidea behind it is you could run marinecable just across there but i don't wantsomebody hooking it as they're out herefishing so i'd like to get it insidesome type of conduit and i'm thinkingthat's going to be the best way to gobut if you guys have any idea on how toget fishermen friendly power from thisbank over to the island leave it in acomment down below but now let's take alook at some of the game camera footageit looks like we got a couple does herefighting over the soybeansand the bucks always seem to get along alot betterand we had a few young deer i think thiswas their first hurricane and theydidn't have a clue what was going on[Music]and i apologize to the bobcat aboutblaming him for the squirrels and nowit's time to feed the most aggressivefish on the planet mr moby[Music]all right folks that's going to wrap upthis video make sure to hit thatsubscribe button because we have a lotof cool things coming up with this pondbuild but i hope you all enjoyed thisvideo and we will see you

rXhGajRFLlY,Race Highlights  2021 Dutch Grand Prix,3868339,95877,1469,"It's lights out and away we go.
Pretty even start from the front two.Verstappen does move over to cut off Lewis Hamilton.
That gets a roar of approval.It is 1, 2, 3: Hamilton in second,
Verstappen leads, Bottas third.And round the first corner we go.
The two Ferraris might be swapping placesas Carlos Sainz comes under a bit of pressure
as well from his team-mate, Charles Leclerc.Round the banking now, and that's the Alpine
past Antonio Giovinazzi of Fernando Alonso.Esteban Ocon has lost places,
but it's a dream start for Max Verstappen,as Giovinazzi gets on the grass
and has to get his elbows out.- Oh, that was a very simple
off-the-line for the front two,but there's so much action now
from Turn 3, Turn 4, Turn 5and through the sweeping right-hander.Into Turn 3. Really exciting with
the Ferraris down low trying a different line.- I tell you what – Fernando almost
got collected by George Russellbefore he took that high line as well.We're on board with Antonio Giovinazzi now,
who lost places on that opening lap,as he sees the Alpine
coming right into his field.And we had to take a step back
from our monitor there.Did he touch there?
- A little bit.- Yeah!
- Every lap in practice they've done the high line,and then suddenly in the race
they've decided that the low line is the better line.- In comes Lewis Hamilton
for his first stop of the race.And I say 'first stop of the race'
because I don't expect those medium tyresto go between now
and the end of 72 laps.- Max is going to react.
That's all he has to do today:Just cover Lewis.
- I was going to ask the question:Do they cover Lewis Hamilton and respond?
And that's exactly what Red Bull are doing.And if you think Mercedes' pit box is tight,
well, it's even tighter for Max Verstappen.But in he comes.
3.6 seconds Lewis Hamilton was stationary.2.7 seconds Max Verstappen was stationary.So is this the race win for Verstappen
or for Hamilton or is it for Bottas?If he's going longer
on a one-stop,do Mercedes think that could be
the best way to run this race now?Tell you what – Max Verstappen has caught
Valtteri Bottas at a good time here.- He ran wide through
the entry to the chicane there,which would have put him
on the back foot.And look how close...
Look how close Max is now.- Yup.
- This is his opportunity.- But look how close Lewis is as well.
Valtteri has done a sterling job hereto try and hold up Max Verstappen.
He's not going to hold him up any longer.Because with DRS,
there he goes!And you can hear the roar from
the Dutch lions in the grandstands,but you can also see the marbles
that are being flicked up into the airwhen he went offline.
Now, going offline is Valtteri Bottasto let Lewis Hamilton through.
And the upshot of the last five or so lapsis a 3.5 second advantage for Max Verstappen
over Lewis Hamilton is now down to just seven tenths.- Look at the marbles that are being
flicked up in Lewis' face from Maxin front on the inside line.Lewis Hamilton let by and past his team-mate
a lot easier than Max Verstappen had found it.I rather get the feeling
we had a Vettel spinner.- Oh, he's gone for the inside,
lost the rear, but was able to collect it up.Oh! Was that Bottas?- That was Bottas.
- He just missed him.That's going to take...
That's going to take a bit of timeoff Valtteri Bottas' charge
towards Verstappen and Hamilton.He lost about 1.5 seconds,
one and a half seconds, in that first sectorbecause he was the car
having to take evasive action.- ""Gap to Perez: one second.
Let's try and hold him up.""- ""Yup.""
- ""Let's go, Daniel. Let's go.You're going to hold Perez up here.""- And this is Daniel Ricciardo
being told to hold up Sergio Perez.But, hold on.
It's not easy.- ""Let's go!
Who's next?""- He's got his mojo back today,
hasn't he? Fantastic!- ""Gap at 3.8. 3.8.""- ""Is he complaining about something or what?""
- ""I think his tyres are done.""- Perez on the outside of Turn 1.
Braving it around the outside.Normally the quicker line to get a good exit,
but he's behind.- ""That was not very fair.""- Ooh! A couple of bits of contact there.- I tell you what, I wanted to see
that replay run on a bit morebecause I think there was a harder hit,
wasn't there,as we cut away to this particular shot.
We might just see it again.There's Lando Norris,
trying to push him wide.And that was wheel to wheel.They're robust if you hit them
in the right places, these cars.- You could hear the wheelspin.Yeah, that was a big lift
of the tyre and suspension.- ""Valtteri, it's James. Please abort
the fastest-lap attempt before the end of the lap.""- Right. So, he's gone purple, purple.Fastest first sector, fastest middle sector
for Valtteri Bottas,and he might just be slowing down a bit
as he crosses the line.He did slow down.
He did abort the fastest-lap attempt.He's still got the fastest lap, though.
- Oh no!- ""I need that extra point, guys.""
- ""Copy. We're on it.""- The pressure's on because
there is that extra point up for grabs.Imagine what happens now,
if Max Verstappen makes a small error nowand Mercedes think, 'Oh no!
We've thrown away the race win',but they've also caused a little bit
of friction within the team itself.Last weekend he won at Spa,
in the country of his birth.This weekend in Holland he is going to win
as a Dutch driver, a Dutch national.And it is Double Dutch delight
for Max Verstappen,who crosses the line to win
the Dutch Grand Prix.Tiesto waves the flag!
Turn up to the Max!Listen to that roar.
- Fantastic, isn't it?What an atmosphere.
And, you know, if you're here and you're watching,and you don't support Max,
it doesn't matter.This is such an amazing atmosphere.
This is Formula 1.- The crucial thing for Hamilton iscan he get the fastest lap of the race
on the last lap of the race?And he does!So, he wins that extra point for the fastest lap
on a day where he and Mercedeswere second best to Max Verstappen
and Red Bull.- “That is a really, really mature drive,
and what a present to your fans: Race win.”- “Well done mate. That was epic! That was epic!
You’ve won your home race!You were brilliant today.
Enjoy this lap and enjoy the podium.""- “Thank you very much, guys.
Amazing strategy.We were really, really sharp today.
And nice pushing 72 laps here. I love it.Great job, guys.""- They've come here for a festival
and a celebration.So he drapes himself in the flag
of the Netherlands.Have a listen to that!What a triple header this is.The washout at Spa
and the race that never was.The sunshine and the celebrations
for Max Verstappen here at Zandvoort.And who knows what Monza will bring us?One thing we can say:
It'll be another fast and frenetic race.",0
LUtVmVBOf94,Battlefield 2042 NEW Gameplay and Details!,1243918,45419,1406,finally after what seems like aneternity we've got some new officialgameplay from battlefield 2042. dicejust released a video it's about aminute and a half long and it's gotgameplay clips of four of thespecialists we've got mckay maria falcboris and casper it briefly introducesall of them and then goes through someof their specialist abilities and perksand there's a ton of stuff to break downhere so we're just going to look at eachclip individually have a quick talkabout it and look at everything that'son offer so without further ado we'regonna get stuck in first with mckay thisguy is an assault specialist and theirspecial ability is the grappling hookand the trait of nimble and in thisfirst clip here very straightforwardlove how that osprey flies over the topgrapples a third-person takedown as wellto me this looks significantly betterthan what we saw in the gameplay traileryou know the original gameplay trailerthat they showed back in june just froma polish standpoint it's looking realnice and in this clip herei think this is on the discarded map youcan see the the nimble trait for mckaygives increased agility when aiming downsights and ziplining so mckay is goingto be a very aggressive specialist greatfor flanks great for just attackingpeople head-on next up is maria falg andthey've changed this one significantlynot just in her appearance but also herspeciality which is that surrept pistolthere so originally the surrep pistolwas able to revive from distance as wellas heal from distance but dice shared abit of insight into this and they saidthat from play testing and the tech testit was a bit too powerful so they'veadjusted things now and instead of beingable to revive from distance it will nowjust heal from distance i can imaginethat if you had a front line and you hada couple of maria falc's just constantlyshooting from cover for example you'redead europe you're dead you're up in agame mode like breakthrough for examplewhich we know this game has the gamejust would never go anywhere becausepeople were constantly open there was noebb and flow to it maybe so they'vechanged it she was a bit too op now shecan just heal from distance but she doeshave that combat surgeon trait thatallows her to revive teammates back tofull health she's the onlyspecialist in the game that can do thati presume that means that the otherspecialists when they revive someonethey won't be back on full health nextup is boris the russian and this dudehas a sentry gun as their speciality anda sentry operator as their trade youseem put the gun down there and itautomaticallyspots and shoots enemies looks like itdoes a little bit of damage there i lovethis clip here and his tray actuallymeans that if he's close to the turretit will boost its efficiency so you canput it down and just run away and itwill do its own thing but it's going tobe quite vulnerable it can be taken outwith emp attacks for example it can betaken out with explosives rocketsgrenades that kind of weaponry but ifyou stand close to it it looks like it'sgonna shoot faster do a bit more damagemaybe have a longer range to it be moreefficient at spotting those enemies thatare a bit further away and then finallyin this video we've got casper who is arecon specialist the speciality is thedrone and the tray is a movement sensorand the clip here nice little ipad theredeploys the drone start spotting peopleyou can actuallymark people with that thing for yourteam and it's supposed to have empattacks as well but in the second cliphere you might be wondering well whatthe hell was going on here well this iscasper's trait motion sensor love thestorm effects on this map by the way itlooks great they take out an enemy onthe bridge with that bolt action sniperrifle and then if someone is near youand creeping up behind you it's gonna bebased on movement speed you'll get alittle alert you see that little redring that pulls to the bottom of thescreen that's gonna let you know thatsomeone is very close to you you mightbe in danger so best turn around andthat's all we got still no official datefor the beta but at least it's somethingthe footage looks great i mean thegraphics in particular as i said i thinkthat's a big upgrade on what we saw atthe dune reveal looks more grittyrealistic more polished i think it bodeswell but let me know your thoughts downin the comments below surprisingly thiswasn't the only new battlefield thingthat happened today battlefield mobileremember a couple months back eaannounced that a proper battlefieldmobile game was being developed by astudio called industrial toys well theyput the google playpage up today and it's got a ton ofinformation about the game on there andsome screenshots and as you can see imean it does kinda look like abattlefield game and i'm pretty surethat this is grand bazaar they arehaving play tests for this soon and i'lllet you know a little bit more aboutthat in just a second so there's a tonof info here i'm not going to go throughall of it because not be boring but justthe headlines so you know exactly whatthis is so this will have all-outwarfare in it and you'll be able tosquad up so you and your crew can playon maps that are both new and familiarto battlefield players so i'd say thatthat is grand bazaar i mean it looksexactly like it so we're gonna have somefan favorite maps being remade formobile as well as some new ones toowe've got tanks we've got atvs and itsays large-scale environmentaldestruction i don't know if there aremany mobile fps games that havedestruction that's a staple of thebattlefield franchise really since badcompany so cool to see that it's comingto mobile as well how detailed it'll bewe don't know yet so they say that itwill have those only in battlefieldmoments as well explosive spectaclesthat battlefield is famous forcollapsing towers you've got atvs you'vegot tanks you're going to be able toparachute while firing a rocket launcheror burying enemies under the ground withrubble that you've destroyed makingevery match unforgettable so it feelslike they're really leaning into the dnaof battlefield with this game and it isa first person shooter maybe they'llhave third person modes but they'resticking with first person it's cool youcan have classes assault support medicrecon getting a lot of bf3 vibes herewhich is kind of good i like that andthen you can customize your loadout witha vast collection of weapons skin classspecific gadgets and more you canpersonalize how you want to play andthere's a little screenshot here with aloadout with an f2000 p226 a small fraggrenade and then a couple more optionstoo this will be free to play but i hopethat they just keep it to cosmetic stuffright don't start charging for thisstuff don't make the same mistakes thatbattlefield 3 had back in the daybecause that was incredibly paid to winand it failed so just cosmetic stuffhere be brilliant yeah it looks likeit's gearing up to be a properbattlefield mobile game we've neverreally had that before cod mobile huge ithink that's one of the reasons that eahave done this and it can offer a bit ofa different take on fps mobile games andthat can but i'm pretty sure that we'llsee warzone mobile too so that's goingto be a heavy hitter when that comes onthe scene now as i said they are testingthis game an additional blog went upwith this and it said that they'resteadily rolling out the battlefieldmobile play tests and they're going tostart with indonesia and the philippinesand these will begin in autumn 2021 sonext couple of months and to start withthey'll only be available on androiddevices but they're going to expand thetests as time goes on onto new devicesand new regions so i'm sure we'll beable to get our hands on it very soonand i've just noticed there too it saidbattlefield mobile is free to play andonly includes cosmetic items battlefieldmobile will feature its own battle passcollectible cosmetics and unlocks uniqueto this mobile game yeah it sounds likethey're gearing it up the correct wayand i hope that they stick to their wordthe game is built for mobile only so itwon't feature any cross play it's goingto feature conquest and they'll releasea lot of additional details soon a bitcloser to the game's launch so there wehave it guys thank you so much forwatching today let me know your thoughtson the new gameplay of 2042 down in thecomments below and also your thoughts onbattlefield mobile

idea for your promotions ofthe of the corporation go on all rightso i have this idea right we rename ourswords and our weapons right we go killhermits when it says shop at bowdom butsee it goes into the chat and it's[Laughter]that's not actually a bad ideathat's actuallyblowing up bad ideas i think we got itwe all know what we're going to do we'veall got a title and yeah we're all we'reallbig enough and smart enough to to dothis rightas head of meetings i declare this onefinished and everyone has their titlesscar is the head of sales you are thehead of industry impulse you are thearchitect pearl and i am the head ofmeetings and marketing and mumbo ofcourse is our glorious ceosounds good potato see you should weseal this with it yeah yeah you got toseal the dealthis is how we seal deals in botom ohwell well well there we go i guess i amnowhead of layouts for bowdoin incorporatedand to be honest straight up looking ateverything right here uh yeah there's afew things that could probably beimproved there is so many like littlescrappy pieces all around the place witha bunch of farms there's mobs upsidedown there's a random bee farm in themiddle of nowhere there's a random scarflying around you know things like thiswe can probably clean up a bit not scarhe's too precious but yeah honestlythere is probably a lot of things we canclean up here and then hopefully nestlein the shops among bhotim and make thisplace look absolutely glorious andprobably a little bit less like a circusbut to be honest maybe that's a littlebit of the charm about it lots to thinkabout lots to do but something todiscuss over time either way we havelots of things to do and lots of thingsto seebeginning with these signs not only ismy base a realm of mystical beings butit's also apparently an animal zoo idon't know which one it's supposed to bebut to be honest i don't think it'seither of those just yet we haven'tquite got enough animals in here towarrant it yes we might have a fewupside down animals but there could bemoremaybe maybe just a few you know i'mbeginning to think we should add our ownsigns to this uh this collection thateven impulse has got going on in hisbase maybe something just like thatthere is no hidden entrance in thisfountain at all there is absolutely nonenot a single hidden entranceperfect you know it's it's been a littlewhile since i turned something upsidedownyou know what yeah i think i'm satisfiedwith that i'm satisfied and with aperfect sign to go with it this phantomis not upside down because clearly it'sup the right way it's perfectly normalyes i am satisfied it also appears wehave a couple of pieces of floating textin the sky asking scouts to build indifferent locations i think cause at themoment we don't really know where scaris going to buildand uh seems there's a bit of a warbetween green and impulse i wonder youknow to be honest i think i wouldn'tmind scar building over there it's offmy mountain i think we need to join inon the fun perfectoy scar mate buddy pal place your swaghere man come onlet's pronounce i'd probably make itlonger if i could but i think that'll doby the way just a bit of an insiderknowledge here swag is actually anaustralian termwhere you pack up your personalbelongings inside like kind of a roll ora bit of a sack and then you take itaround with you on your journeys campingwhatever living area but i thought thatkind of fit with scott's wagon sowhatever it can be a little bit aussiesometimes you knowby now you've probably also noticed theextra trees and rocks in my mountaini'll be leaving that till later toexplain but i'll get back to it don'tworry the next thing for us toacknowledge is actually the delivery ofour medal so you remember how we were inthe no wings club and i got by a hundreddays iskall popped around and deliveredit so we got our first medal congrats onreaching a hundred days news club so weare actually a part of both clubs we arewearing these at the moment but i didwant to get to at least 100 days for thefirst medal we're going to have todisplay this somewhere i think i'm kindof feeling right up here like a pictureframe on the wall maybe there we go alsomade the item frame invisible so that itcan kind of just sit on the wall alittle bit nicer i believe we have likesome sort of data pack or something onthe server that allows us to you know beable to turn those invisible so that'sreally cool all right so there's onemore thing to check up on before we doget to the big stuff whatit appears we have a new friend what onearth happened to my bee and why isthere agreen little dude sitting in the boatinstead why do i see that blowing up atsome point please don't blow up my faceguys please not this time i could killthe creeper but i kind of want to leavehim there it'd be kind of funny if itblew up not gonna lie just saying allright did we make any sales in the shopfor todayoh we got four diamonds in the tintedglass but no more sold in the glasschest so it looks like we're kind oflike lowering in diamonds with everyepisode i make we're getting less andless returnfrom the ship so it kind of seems likethat's something we probably need towork on in the future maybe make thelamada presence a little bit moreprominent i do have to check those guysbut i don't think they've sold anythinganywaybut we probably do need to reassess howwe're selling our items in the futureand it's probably a good idea to thinkabout considering we're starting upversion incorporated now but hey atleast it's something to add to mydiamond pile i'm slowly going downbecause i keep buying resources andcoins that aren't gonna get me anythingback but you know it's fine i still gotenough now it's time to acknowledge theelephants on the islandsby portion of the gigabase yes that'sright it's time to actually startbuilding the actual structure before wedo get started on the structure thoughi'm just going to quickly explain what'sgoing on with like the rocks and thetrees this is actually something that ibuilt on stream the other day and wedecided to go with like kind of a pinetree feeling just to kind of go withwhat scars going uh got going on overhere of course my trees aren't anywherenear as large as scars are but we'rekind of like trying to keep a bit of aconsistent style so we can emerge a fewof the buildings together and try tomake a harmony or some sort of harmonyuh around bowdoin so those are kind ofthere and i am thinking that kind ofstyle for the the rocks and the bushesto be placed around but i did leave itthere because i think it's importantthat we kind of get the baseline of astructure down first so that we can dothe trees and the rocks around thestructure to accompany it if we buildall the trees now odds are we're goingto have to remove them later when webuild the structure so it's probablybest that we leave them until after weat least kind of get some kind ofbaseline down i understand i've alsokept the concept for my quote-unquotemega bass ideauh as a secret from you guys this wholetime episode nine and i haven't told youguys what i'm gonna get up to mygigabase portion does indeed havesomething to do with the theming of mystarter base in which of course as youcan see is some boats but that's onlyone very small portion of it my overallconcept is actually going to be alighthouse castlei know that might sound a little bitweird but the kind of the idea behind itis that we have kind of a fantasy-esquehybrid between the lighthouse and thecastle itself so it's very much going tobe focused on the fact that thelighthouse is going to be thecenterpiece howeverthe rest of the components of the castleportions are gonna be reminiscent of alighthouse as wellhonestly i'm not 100 sure on how i'mgoing to exactly build it i've beentrying to i've been like trying tosketch and mock up all these differentkinds of things in order to try and getmy ideaworking in my minds to be able to startbuilding it but it's a little bit roughso far and it's going to merge boatscastle lighthouse all together into oneand kind of my idea almost looks a bitlike a lotus fella but you know what ishould stop talking about it and justbuild it i think it's time to cue thetime-lapsethat was close[Music]okay so i know it's all stone and alsoapparently really covered in snow rightnow hold on guys let me just fix thatfor one momentah that's better no snow i do know ihave to string this up eventually buti'm going to get most of the buildingsin first before doing all the strengthso it would help will happen but for nowwe'll just have to roll withdigging the snow off manually so like isaid before as well i do indeed know itis all stone and it's not usuallysomething i would show you guysbut for something like this i think iwant to give you guys a really goodsense of the direction that i'm headingin without you having to wait weeks andweeks to see you know kind of where i'mgoing with itnot to mention when i do build iactually build like this i make thebasic shape first so i can get a reallygood sense of like the composition ofthe creation itself now these aren't theonly buildings i'll be making but it isdefinitely a star and it's going to bethe pinnacle of the build this is goingto be like the centerpiece and i'll havemore buildings all the way around it tokind of end up as a castle in the end sothe reason i don't add detail as i go isbecause later on i might honestly removea portion of the build because i don'tlike it in its composition and if i dohave to do that you know i'm not goingto be removing a whole bunch of detailthat i've spent hours you know gruelingover getting the resources for that kindof thing i can just remove it and that'sjust a hunkerstone and it's finewe will be adding details probably inthe next episode or so but for now thisis a really good way to kind of justshow you guys the direction i'm headingwithout it being just a whole bunch ofuh wool as an outline so yeah this isn'tthe whole build we've got so much moreto go in terms of structures and whatnotbut i think the shape of this is lookingreally really promising all right got afew slow folding potions so we can lastin the area a little bit longer so i canshow you guys all these small detailsbut if you check around the base of thestructure as well i've kind of got thislike lotus flower design happening witha whole bunch of different little shipsthat of course will be decorated but ifyou look here it's basically like aneight-pointed star of boats and i likeit i'm happy with it we've got the twolighthouse towers to represent the peakof the castle here also with a sailright in the middle of them this isgoing to be a little bit more bendy oncewe make the proper details to the actualstructure itself but we'll beincorporating a whole bunch of likedifferent sails and boat pieces allthroughout the build to go with thelighthouse nautical theme maybe in thefuture we could do some kind of creatureintertwining through the build you knowyou never really know we could do someplants as well there's all kinds ofdifferent possibilities that we canreally do with this build i'm reallyreally excited to see where this projectdoes lead to but i'm really happy withwhat we currently have at the momentalthough i am happy with how it is rightnow i didn't kind of encounter maybe alittle bit of a problem while i wasbuilding the mountain istoo smallthe mountains i spent all this timebuilding the mountainand it's too small look at the buildingon top of that thing it is coveringso much of the mountain already itselfand we need to be adding way more to itand it just feels like the scale is alittle bit outweighed at the moment sowhat we do need to do here is add awhole chunk to the left side of thispiece of terrain here because thisstructure is quite tall and i want tosee the terrain kind of balanced out alittle bit more with structure versuslandand because i realized that we do needto make the mountain even bigger i'mgoing to need way more resources againso what i did during my building processis i made this little cactus farm it'snot huge it's something that i swingedon the fly from memory and it's alreadybeen producing you know a somewhatdecent amount of stuff because i had tobuy a lot of cactus from joelast time i built this mountain and ibasically sold him outso i needed to build my own and now wehave a bit of a supply of cactus whilei've been building everything else andthat works out quite nicely however wehave run out of time for this episode sowe'll have to focus on the mountain inthe next one i'm really really enjoyingthis build direction i think it has alot of potential for the future but whatdo you guys think so far let me know inthe comments below with that said wehave run out of time for this episode sothat'll be it for today thank you all soso much for watching this episode todayand my hermitcraft journey it's been anabsolute blast so fari will see you guys in the next onegoodbye guys oh okay there we go byeow don't go this way that's a bad way togo okay goodbyeguys i wasn't recording i wasn'trecording don't now you're lyingyou've pulled this beforeyou can't get me that oftenoh youthe green who cried wolf,0

sandwiches but that allchanges today with the new t-roychick-fil-a location we are now onlyopen on sundays i might get banned fromlife from chick-fil-a for doing this butwe're doing it anyways the goal for asuccessful restaurant is just toencourage people to eat more chicken andof course people want to eat chickenespecially on sundays so that is why weare only open on sundays it's simplereally we just need to encourage peopleto eat more chicken and our studies showthat 9 out of 10 people already preferto eat chicken on sundays eat morechickens chick-fil-a only opened onsundaysthe

F_OOTBRjY18,Evolving The Biggest Army Possible To Win,389431,15702,194,so a lot of people are telling me thisis actually really easy to do when i'mdoing it wrong while i don't disagreewith them i'm still struggling to makeany progress but that's exactly whatwe're going to try and do we're going totry and make a massive army today mostlyby surrounding the other guys andconstantly attacking armies that are thesame size or slightly bigger preferablyones that are also quite tiny thoughbecause we can just get two free unitsthere while taking little damage inreturn and then i think this is probablya good size armory to work on thoughwe're getting attacked from behindhopefully we can kind of de-aggro thoseor we can just turn the table on themokay the army's already getting prettybig tempted to fight that one i thinkthey're just a little bit too big for usso we're gonna see if we can cleanly getthis one out of the way so far so good ithink i'm starting to understand now ifyou want things done the proper way youshouldn't be watching anything i do everthis is where i always start to feellike i'm being too timid like i shouldbe attacking many things right now uhwe're gonna attack the uh four amigoshere because if we surround them withoutgetting other army we should be goodyeah it's all about movement so if wecould properly surround him there we arewe're now quite a bit stronger becauseof those four units we're gonna see evengrab these three out of the crowd whilemoving away oh i think i lost themthat's okay because i have another fouramigos up here and that's okay we'regonna trade in some of our weaker unitsfor stronger units i don't know how bigthis army is in particular but we'rekind of gonna go for it and uh oh we didget them though we actually killed thewhole army i didn't think i was gonnaget away with that okay this is goinggreat uh it would be great if i couldget the rest of my corpses from overthere i wish i intercepted those five ohbut i might still get him as long as thebig boys up top don't come at me frombehind uh because if they do i'm introuble but i got some more and we'regonna take these guys i've got enough ithink i could probably take out these aslong as i get a proper surround on thembecause if you can hit them from allsides it's basically seven on one andwelluh that's really unfortunate timing ireally wish that didn't happen thatbasically screwed us but i think i gotthe hang of this now wait there mightstill be hope we can build up a littlebit of momentum with these guysyeah the key is trying to like wrap yourarmy around the other army which is alittle bit tricky to do because controlsare a little bit weird and since we'redoomed here anyway i just want todemonstrate how strong these guys are sowe can be excited to have one on ourteam later he's one shot at half my armytwo shots three shots you get the ideaso let's try that again this time i'vebasically taken the center of the mapand i'm just gonna hold that take outeverything i can along the way okay wegot a pretty good sized army going i'mhoping i can get these guys uh deadreally quick and then i'm gonna turn tothe left to get these guys and this is apretty good start again then maybe i canturn it into the guys down below but ireally need to finish off these oh isthis oh i thought there was only threeof these this is gonna be bad againyeah see that might have worked had thearmy of 16s not rolled up behind me seethere's definitely still a luck factorto this because that was an okaystrategy i could have taken him butsomething stronger spawned on the edgeof the map so i take no responsibilityfor my actions maybe i just need morecoffee okay this time i think we'regonna get a really big army provided wecan finish off these guys and we'regonna pull whatever we can away thenwe're definitely gonna focus on theseguys while getting attacked from behindbut that's okay i think we'll be okaywith thisbecause we got some of them then we'regonna turn and fight against this littlearmyit's getting hard to keep track ofwhat's what but we got all of these nowand all of theseso the middle is pretty well cleared outright now there's not a lot in therewhich is nice that means i can take mypick of what i can attack down belowthen we're gonna grab these fiveand then the little guys also i'm noteven considering them beings anymorethen these guys wander nice and close tothe edge which is a very good presentfor me because i could probably mostlyattack them without issue yep thebiggest set to my existence is beingattacked from behind and uh if i'm upnear the edge that happens lessdefinitely getting a pretty big army oftier twos so we need to find a nice armyof tier threes to bridge into that butthis is actually really good so farbecause i've got lots of tier twos plusthe uh grim reaper guys and we'rehopefully gonna get a few more righthere then we're gonna run away kind ofstalking these guys hopefully draw themout that's probably too big that's kindof the problem though hesitation willkill you so quick in this game becauseyou miss an opportunity never to have itagain and then you're behind and nowwe're getting golemthat this guy would have been way betterto attack you know let's still attackthem we might get away with this thingsare our grim reapers they do a lot ofdamage and they're pretty tough yeahthere we go we got some tier threes onour team now we're tougher than wethought i think this is the remainder ofthe corpses down below i think all igotta do is kill him to get those okay istarted playing too passively and ithink i lost all the momentum i neededbut if i can get the right opportunitiesi think i can still do this thanks tothose grim reapers we gotta stay awayfrom golems though because they'lldestroy my whole army instantly wow tierones are still spawning in for somereason that's weird are you theleftovers for down below i really wantthis group i have seven grim reapersthough that's kind of ridiculous i thinkat that point i might be able to take agolem i really should have attacked thati think i'm gonna pretend this is anopportunity andcircle around them okay we completelyscrewed that up that's probably the endof us keep going surround them no ithink we're doomeduh we're doing so good come on fight wecan do this oh we can oh we can do thisgreat oh this will be a nice littlebolster to our army they're not superstrong but they're to be basically waterat this pointthey can be our meat shield while we'reattacking better things here's a nicelittle tier 3 army i think i couldprobably run through pretty quickhopefully not getting too much of theother one in our way i really need agolem though to help clear out some ofthe crap i really like to get a hold ofone of these if i can so i'm going totry and fight my way in andyeah i think i got a golem now as longas i kill the rest of these perfect sothe golems are where we really start towalk through other units because they'remega stronguh oh this might have been a bad ideawe're gonna try and fight all this i'mhoping my golem can equal their golemsmy golem's dead oh we just lost it allwe flew too close to the sun but thatgives me optimism this game is way toomuch fun i think one of the big keys toois that once i start to hit tier two ishould go back and kill more of the tierones to kind of up my numbers a littlebit because i can take out a pretty bigtier one army with this many tier twosand then i can attack bigger two twoarmies just because i have more attackuh as long as those other guys don't hitme which they're going to so thatprobably cost me well i'm getting awaywith some units at least so we'll countthat as a draw what i really need arethose grim reapers so if he wants tocome out and play i would be happy totake him i think we're dead againyup too many enemies man i'm doing sogood until i'm not yeah i got anotherpretty good army going this is usuallywhere you start to fall apart but we'redoing pretty good we got all sorts ofgrim reapers plus some tier three unitsin there so i think we're at the pointwhere we could take on a golem but notmore than one this army would be nice toget a hold of if we can just kind ofblast through them real quick come onthere it is let's back off okay i didn'texpect everything to get so aggressivethere i don't think we came out on topthere i think we lost more than wegained there's a golem with three unitsyeah we're gonna go for this i don'tknow if this is a good idea but i wantto golem really badly i think we'll beable to do this as long as we actuallyget some damage in on that stupid golemcome on couple hits come on 1v1okay once again got a nice big army oftier twos built up i'm able to prettyconsistently get this far at least thenfrom here it's just a matter ofcarefully navigating through enough toget some tier threes like that don'treally know this guy is alone so i knowif i kill him i'll get a nice littlereward for that i'm not sure where hiscorpsey friends are but we might findout eventually wow everyone got bunchedup in the center okay we gotta move awayfrom that i'm gonna fight this becausei've got a pretty big horde going i caneasily surround them and that's gonnamean a quick death for them we're gonnalose a few tier ones but that's okay wedon't want tier ones i think we're gonnatry and go for this golem and tierthrees right now uh we're also gettingsome new units from somewhere not reallysure what that's about might have made amistake again back up okay we're gonnayeah i made a mistake and you need somuch power to fight the golems okay nowwe're getting somewhere i've got fivegrim reapers lots of tier twos and evenlots of tier threes so i need to find asingle golem to start my littleadventure or even a decent-sized army oftier threes like that if they come yeahjust a little bit further i think i canactually take these out really quicknot really quick but quick enough that ican overrun them and then take theirsouls and be on my way then i'm going totake out these whatever this iswith hopefully not getting ganked frombehind all right i got a prettyserviceable army right now should i turnand fight these i might as wellsince they offered to come and die uhbut now my army is getting to thatannoying size where it's hard tomaneuver quicklyso we're gonna take out all of thesepretty much instantly then we're gonnatake out these tier threes also almostinstantly i'm getting to that side so ican just overrun pretty much everythingbut the army yeah is very slow to reactso i need to keep it very near the edgeand be very opportunistic but whenanything wanders even just a little wayout of the crowd like that i'm going tooverrun it andgot it to emphasize how strong we are weuse just a little part of our army toabsolutely destroy that thing thenhere's a few more tier threes we're justgoing to uh nip the edge of i guessand then we're going to take these herethrees as well i guess we'll just kindof wait here and take whatever happensjust spawn inprobably not the worst strategy in theworld you got a pretty big army thoughi've definitely never had one this bigand i guess i'm mostly just kind ofgonna wait for whatever to come out tomy edge and kill it and then retreatback a little bit eventually i'll getall of that oh look at all these guysthey're just asking to dieuh i resurrected something in the middleso they're just getting obliterated butthat's their problem the army's so bignow like i'm basically confined to thiscorner like it's hard to even move themi can't pull the cursor far enough thatwould have been nice to spawn it near mei would have loved to take that i wish icould like look because i need to seehow big that massive idiot is i don'tknow if i can like march in there or noti can take a little corners like this noproblem but as soon as like a stack ofgolems comes i'm pretty boned but i'mgoing to take out another little tier 2army right here you know i'm just goingto go for these golems let's just get inhere and see what happens i don't wantto wait any longer i have no idea thisis a good or a bad ideawe're going to come around the bottom ineed golems oh i have a golemoh interesting okay so i've got onegolem i'm gonna back out a little bitbecause i think i'veprobably got a good grasp on things nowi'm gonna try and take out this armyreal quick if i canuh so i just brought some more units inmy golems are working hard i'm notreally sure what's happening right nowit's kind of hard to see exactly what ihave or what i'm killing i think i'mpretty much just gonna march through themiddle at this pointi think i lost my golem though so igotta back out look how many corpsesthere are though oh here's a golem herelet's take this one yeah let him in killhimthat was quick and easy okay we're gonnatake out this little herd of tier threesalsoi think i've probably got a few golemsthere i can resurrect should i kill theappropriate idiots we're gonna see if wecan take out these two golems i'm hopingwe can really quick before those otherones get to us yup okay so now we've gotlike eight creme reapers and two golemsand we can negroman some more guysthere's not a lot of golems in themiddle so i'm just gonna march into themiddle right now and hopefully be ableto decimate this with a little surroundaction oh there we go i finally broughta lot of my idiots to lifeyeah we have a massive army now this isfungotta keep an eye on the enemy golemsthough because if we start to lose ourswe need to back out so we're backing outit's crazy how strong they are like wehad an army like the size of everythingand they absolutely destroyed our golemsbut we're gonna get these idiots up tophopefully quick and we lost a lot of ourgrim reapers there too the grim reapersare like mini golemsand it would be better if i could findlike oh we got a golem back no nevermind i feel like we're mostly gettingpairs of golems to fight against andthat makes it very hard if it's one wecan destroy them like instantly if it'stwo they do a lot of damage before theydieso it's kind of a war of attrition but ithink i can still do this because myarmy is pretty strong we got lots oftier threes lots of grim reapers we justneed a few golems to be on our side andsurvive and look at that another twospawned in of course they did gonna takeout a big army of tier twos here whichwill help bolster the numbers basicallytheir pawns to die but i'd rather themdie than my expensive units justresurrected a whole bunch of other unitsi'm not even sure where they were hidingokay we got another goal and we got twomore golems okaywe should be able to move into them alittle bit okay we're gonna back out andpick our opportunities nowwe got our golem up here we got a lot ofunits down below we can resurrect atsome point i just need that golem tostay alive there we gothis little army wandered way out weresurrected some more middle units sothey're whatever they're gonna die but idon't care got some more out of theresome tier threeswe're gonna take these guys also get thegolem in there so we're gonna see if wecan take the bite out of this littlecorner to take these guys oh that golemwould have been nice but we'll just takethese for now and then back out againwe're gonna march with other army on theway out we're gonna avoid the golems butwe're gonna take him if i could like getthem to fan out a little better so theycan wrap around an enemy that would becool but it's hard to get them to dothat so we'll just take out a few moretier threes avoiding the golems likealways uh as soon as i get two golemsclear out there i'm gonna try and hm ifi could get two separated from the crowdi could take on two fairly easily but ifthere's anything more than that we're introubleso we'll fight these two for a seconduh we might have to back out herebecause the other golems came in andwe're about to be attacked from behindas well so let's take out these at leastwe're getting lots of idiots spawning inthat we can easily take out here it'sjust breaking at that mass in the centeragainst all the golems is almostimpossiblethose two golems only have a few otherswith them if i can kill them i'm prettysure i'm going to get a nice chunk outof the middle but the golems are alwaysso close together can we take out theseoneshere we go one of the golems down i meanyeah okay we got the golems now i justneed to find the rest of their idiotsother golems are close i can't take outfour of them though not unless i have afew of my own at least wait wait i'mgonna have these ones maybe separatedokay we're gonna go for these golemsbecause i think i got them yupdefinitely not gonna fight big boy yetthat would be really stupid of mebut now that i have a few golemsgot another one dead i'm not sure wherehis friends are but we're gonna try andget in there to hopefully yeah there wego we got three golems now okay gonnabust through these guys because once thegolems are in the front they're gonnadecimate everythingthen we can back out oohthis little army segregated itself fromthe other guys so we're gonna go aheadit's two three golems versus two sogot emi still want this center mass likethere's so many units on the ground ohwe had some more golems over therethat's goodall right i think we're starting toresurrect some of our units so we'rejust gonna try and kind of walk throughthis center mass a little bit no we'regonna back out that's stupid okay a bigbig army just spawned on the left sowe're gonna take them out nice andeasily i don't even have to do anythingat that pointi just gotta kill a few more of likesomething in hereto really start picking up whatever's onthe ground i've got so many units on theground i just can't use them becausethey're well they're deadbut here's another golem for mewe're going to take him out nice andquick and take a few bites out of themyeah i got a few of the ground units upand we're going to use them to marchinto this little corner because there'san army or two right here i want thegolem backed out okay and we're gonnaback out got them it's so hard tocontrol an army this big like they kindof just go wherever they want andthey're really hard to pull away fromother armiesi saw an opportunity to take thesegolems so hopefully we'll get them oncei get all the golems out of the middlei'm pretty sure i could just march rightthrough without any concern whatsoeverbut that's a pretty big if because ialready lost all of my golems theregod i'm back got a whole bunch morethings back i really need these golemsto diecan i get them now okay the golems aredead i think all of the golems are deadright now so i'm gonna try and use thisopportunity totake over a few more armies got lots ofgrim reapers going i think i'll walkthrough all of thesethere's so many units on the ground ijust don't know what i need to kill toget themi gotta get this golem dead and i gottamove away from thatlots of golems though golems are reallygonna be the core of my army now uh i'mliterally just spamming right click as igo yeah hoping to get yeah there we gosome of those ground units upthere we go now we're taking over thismap this is funand i'm not even really properlycontrolling things anymore i'm just kindof walking and pressing right click sothings come up as soon as i canthere we go there's still so many unitson the ground like who do i need to killto get those is it you guys do you guysneed to die great okay now we'll takeover some of you okay so there's still afew units on the ground which is curiousbecause likei've killed everything like i'm justholding the center of the map at thispoint we can walk to an army like thisno problem and that's a big army justgotta keep an eye on the golems they'rethe key if i lose them we're in troubleagain but again look at all the units onthe ground where are their friendsi think i've conquered pretty mucheverything i can right nowso we're gonna go ahead and take outthese and then i think we're gonna trythe big guys in the cornerbecause i think that's really the onlything we can do at this point i guess wecan make our army a little bigger stilllike here's some tier twos we'reabsolutely gonna destroy so that's easythen we'll take out some tier threesdown here i can only have four golems imaybe want a few more before i'm gonnayeah look at all of them down there i'mgonna need more golems here's one more ican addthey're definitely gonna hurt my armybut we're going to hurt them back weneed to golomize their golemscome on golems get on themand then we're going to get those onesoh they heard my golems pretty bad therei guess that's kind of the problem whenthey send an army this big in theirgolems are going to defeat a lot ofmeyer army before my golems hit theirgolems i don't know if that even madesense but we need our damage to hit themfirst this might be a good opportunitybecause yeah my golems can one-shottheirs if they hit them properly so nowwe're up to five and the grim reapersdefinitely help because they can getfrom anywhere okay we're gonna takethese two hopefully very quickcome on hit him with all the damagebecause every time we fight golems ifeel like we don't necessarily gainanything like we actually lost one thereby fighting too but i do at least have apretty sizable army so i'm not feelingvery unconfidentwe can even fight both of these at thesame time if we want because it is veryquickly surround that one we resurrecteda whole bunch of units from down southapparently and we're gonna finish offthis army i see another goal am i goingto add to my uh collection so we'rehopefully going to hit them with mygolem really quickand we still lost a golem they're sohard to get because they're so stronglike i'm down to two golems now becausei fought a few other golems okay we'reup to four so i'm gonna fight big boydown in the bottom pretty quick well wehave all of this but i want these grimreapers alsoso the golems are in the front linethey're gonna destroy all of that noproblem then let's fight him and then iwant to see if i can add this golem thisis kind of kind of a stupid idea whenhe's near a rock i wonder if we can likelure one of them out i don't know if ican fight all that there's so many ofthem there's one two three four five sixseven and i mean two of these sizegolems destroy me i don't know what todo here well we're gonna fight theseidiots at our back because they're tiertwos anyway they don't really pose muchof a threatthen we're gonna clean up the middlejust a little bit uh and we're gettinggolem from the left so we've gotta dealwith thatwe're gonna clean out the middle herereal quick and then we're just going tocharge into the bottom left because idon't know how to do that anyways we didtake a little lost in golems there butlet's see exactly how strong these guysare let's just do it okay right guysready surround the golems and defeateverythinguh so far they seem pretty obnoxiouslystrongyeah that's not gonna work i do not knowhow to destroy them we have to fightthem one at a time but how do we fightthem one at a time fortunes can changejust that quickly well well well how theturntables really have no idea how i wassupposed to fight the big golems maybejust fight them earlier on beforethere's so many of them down therewhatever the case we had an army bigenough to take on the center of the map,0
bcQu8zXPh-w,I've been thinking of retiring.,2569670,428488,3659,so I usually click bait these titles andthese thumbnails so I I imagine mostpeople are clicking into this videothinking I'm joking and this is about tobe some elaborate scheme but uh it's notI I have not enjoyed making videos onYouTube uh for a whileand I guess you guys might have beenable to pick up on that given the factthat I haven't uploaded in you know twomonths it's been all but radio silenceuh from my campand even the recent videos have justbeen me just I've just been kind ofsitting down just like talking about howgrumpy I am it's just been old man yellsat Cloud for uh for for the months Ihave been here and and honestlywhat right do I have you know what rightdo I have to complain about my situationgetting

back when I was you know enjoyingwhat I was doingand umI did a full tour of the of the room ifyou guys are interested in that and youcan watch that right up there and uhwhile I was there I started thinkingabout the the stuff I do enjoy aboutmaking videos I think a lot aboutYouTube obviously this is my jobum and I think a lot about how dumb thissite is right how can I how how the [ __ ]can I talk aboutwhat anything I talk about right and getthe amount of views I get and and be assuccessful as I am right now and youknow it's it's it's meaningless man it'sit's it's fairy dust you know it is Ican walk out the door right now the everrevolving door of just of [ __ ] willwill open and out pops another dude witha New York hat and a funny accent rightand he's gonna do the job he he will bethe new funny man you know I'mreplaceable you know I I what I'm doinghere is replaceable and I startedthinking about you know like what wouldI do if I coulddo this job foreverand would I do it forever obviously yesum I think I will be doing this in somecapacity forever I mean this is this ismy [ __ ] dream right this iseverything I've ever I've Ever Wantedsince you know since elementary schoolwhen I was watching when I was watchingall these people you know and if I coulddo YouTube Foreverit sure as [ __ ] wouldn't be me yellingabout Dick and boss and you knowplugging in the old LogiTech C920 webcamand and [ __ ] blowing everybody's earsout with a funny mic because that thatis apparently comedy in 2020.umI dude I moved to Austin to I moved toAustin to be around peopleI moved to Austin because there arepeople who do this job that I want towork with and I want to do stuff inperson you know I don't want toI don't want to sit in a roomthat's completely [ __ ] empty formonths and just complained becausethat's all I've been doing man and Imean the most fun I've had in recentmemory was when I went to LA for mypodcast chuckle sandwich and uh me Tednivison and Charlie slime sickleum basically just sat down on this inthis beautiful [ __ ] set we had a neonsign it looked like a diner like it wasjust sick and we got we got [ __ ]Michael Reeves on we got Aaron Hansenfrom Game Grumps we got all these peoplethat I respect like so so much and wejust had great conversations with themand it was so much funum and that's the kind of stuff I wantto do I want I want to make shows like Iwant to do stuff with people this is aset I'm sure you've noticed this isbecause my room has just been it's justbeen emptyfor God knows how long I've just beentalking with an empty wall but this isno this is a set that I made and this isa this is for a show that I'm making andproducing and doing every likethis is what I this is what I want to[ __ ] do you know andand another thing that I want to do andit's going to sound really [ __ ] weirdto to most people because I I've nevertalked about this on this channel it'sjust spread through word of mouth andalgorithm I guess but umpleck uh for the channel That means themost to me and has consistently been youknow the most rewarding and the most funand and fulfilling project I've everdone on YouTubeum this is the plaque for my Call ofDuty commentary Channel and it's calledthe weekly slapand I'm sure you guys know of c nettersand Woody's gamer tag and all those guysthat I dude they're still doing [ __ ]right and that's so weird becausethey're still on the platform doingstuff and those are the two people likedude they were my favorite people on theplanet they were my favorite [ __ ]people likeever ever and I come home every day andI listen to them talk about ideas justrandom ideas that they were that they'rethinking about just likethought-provoking [ __ ] they're givinglife advice and that kind of stuff allthe while they're just playing Call ofDutyand murdering hundreds of people in anonline lobby with a machine gun likethat juxtaposition was just so funny tome and so so special to me and thisChannel that I do the weekly slap isjust uh it's like a almost like afaithful continuation of thatum it's meplaying the same Call of Duties thatthey played games from you know the2000s like Modern Warfare 2

tosayhave you ever gotten a ferris wheel andthen instantly regretted it on a windyday this is so precarious but the savinggrace is the amazing view of the akashikaikyo bridge one of the largestsuspension bridges in the entire worldthe thing that taints the atmospheresomewhat is we are joined unfortunatelybyhi it's connor and this is wacky weekendlucky weekend[Music][Applause][Music]so once a month for one weekend colorand i meet up for a wacky weekendsomewhere around japan for this month ithought i would complete my ultimatetask of visiting all 47 prefectures injapan i've got just two i've yet tovisit i'm richard uh takashima and kochiboth in shikoku island where we're aboutto go into and now i do want tocelebrate this momentous occasion you'veessentially completed japan so i havearranged some special accommodation justthe finest accommodation i could findwhy am i very cynical and why there'snothing to worry about this is good it'sliterally gonna be something [ __ ] like idon't know it's something that's gonnabe an experience the cheapest hotel nono no no no not at alli'm very excited i don't trust youconnor but either way i want to get outthis down ferris wheel like if you movelike you can see the whole thingi don't know why i did that i was veryscared beforeso now that i'm here i don't really feellike it was that difficult to get to isthere a reason why you haven't exportedbecause i'm your driverto be honestlike that's the thing like shikoku ispretty tough to get to you do need likethree or four days in a car and that'swhy i've never been to tokushima andkochi before they're pretty inaccessiblei also think i haven't really heard muchabout it well they're incredibly rurallike tokushima is famous for beingpretty much emptygreat can't wait to see it and one ofthe places we're going to go to is agreat symbol of that but when the firstplace i want to take you today on thistrip is a bridge that looks like it'sstraight out of indiana jones rememberthe temple of doom yeah of course thebridge goes over yeah there's that [ __ ]where is it why was it safe it can't besafe i mean in normal weather conditionsit'd be greatbut unfortunately there's a typhoon thisweek i've had a weather warning for thepast three days on my phone warning meabout rains in this area but of courseno road trip would be complete withoutthe perfect road trip sorry don't do itdon't do itwhat the [ __ ] i don't want to do thiswrong with this placeno volcano i love it[Music]and so as we head deep into themountains of tokushima and the incomingstorm makes short work of the blue skiesconnor and i arrive at our firstdestination a 150 foot rope bridgeprecariously hanging over a disturbinglyferocious riverwhat is that look at that the bridge wecan't cross that that's a set piece inan action movie you know the bridge youcut when the bad guys are chasing you sothey all fall down but for the bridgeyou actually go across in normaleveryday life do we have to go on it yesyes you dowe can't do that look at itoh my god13 road bridges once spanned the earvalley but today only three survive oneof which is the kazura rope ridgesuspended 45 feet over the river andmade using five tons of vines which needto be replaced every three years it's asvisually striking as it is unsettling inever got a chance to use my engineeringdegree while i was doing youtubebut i feel qualified enough to tell youthis is not a material that we madebridges out of i do not feel safe withthis this is terrifying these are justtwigs they found on the ground what arewe doingi don't want to do this i've watched acouple cross it for the last 20 minutesvery slowly and methodically struggletheir way over it the water below looksabsolutely ridiculous likeit's the most ferocious water i thinki've ever seenyou're deadnear that you're immediately deadnotice how every single person crossingthe bridge is clutching onto it for dearlife they're so terrified even take onestep on the bridge and so with the riverbelow about to break its banks and aviolent thunderstorm in the clouds aboveagainst my better judgment would beginto cross the bridge and quickly regretitoh it's so slipperyoh my god the gaps are massive look atthis i can put my whole foot throughthat's not good that's not good that's ano that's so dangeroushow is this a tourist attraction this isa death trapcomingi'm not playing this up for the camerathis is actually terrifyingcome on chris what's the problemlook at the riveri'm like the heaviest person that's evercome on this bridgei am worriedit's big mouth isn't itthe gaps get biggerit's like it's because i'm holding theumbrella oh [ __ ] off look at thateven if it wasn't the rainiest day in200 years this would have been scarythe fact the water looks like that likeif you fall inyou're dead do you think you couldsurvive that no nonowhile connor speed runs the bridge likecrash bandicoot meanwhile i can't takemy eyes off the water transfixed on thealarming river rapids belowhurry up we get over the bridgego go go [ __ ] goi'm stuckhe's done it he survived the bridgelegitimately one of the scariest thingsi've done in japan oh my god the rainthe water the wind how do you feel chrisi want to get in the car i want to gohomeman that's scary there's literallynothing stopping you from falling inwith your leg there's there's nothingit's so dangerousi feel alive hey eight out of tenafter being spiritually reborn on atreacherous rope bridge connor and iseek shelter deeper into the valley at arather unique place in fact unique is anunderstatement because here in chicago'smost isolated valley lies the village ofnagaro a place where the humanpopulation is outnumbered ten to one byeerily lifeline scarecrows350 of themso we've been driving through some ofthe worst rain i've ever seenhave we turned the corner i'm not happyabout this chris i want to go home ithought they were like villagers ithought they were like locals who werejust sitting at the side of the roadit's the first of the scarecrows there'stwo in a wheelchair one's standing one'sjust falling over it's quite creepybecause we just passed uh someconstruction being done and i thoughtthere was just two employees just uhdoing some construction but they werejust scarecrows it was really creepyliterally all the roads are closed wereally shouldn't stay a lot we areactually gonna get stuck in the middleof nowhere with these scarecrowsas we slowly make our way into nagorowithout a single human being in sight wegradually begin to appreciate the sheerscale of the village's scarecrowpopulationwhat is this craze what is thisohoh my god i don't like this chris youdon't like this no i do not yeahoh no i'm not going in there i'm notgoing in therelook at it get in[Music]like if there was like eight i'd be likeoh that's kind of cool but there's like80.i don't like this can we go nowthe story of nagaro is one that you'llhear across japan that of a dyingvillage on the brink of extinctionjapan's population is shrinking fasttoday the population stands at 126million but in just 30 years time it'sforecast to drop below 100 million andit's out here in rural japan where theeffects are being felt the most nagaraonce had 300 residents that called thevillage home today there's around just25.11 years ago residents kimi ayanoreturned back to the village to lookafter her father and after he passedaway she decided to commemorate him bycreating a scarecrow doll in his imageand then she never stopped some dollswere actual people that lived in thecommunity others fictional charactersand while ayano is upfront about thefact that she makes the scarecrowssolely for fun rather than some kind ofstatement on depopulation it doesn'tstop the atmosphere of the villagehaving an almost haunting sadness therealization of what much of japan'scountryside towns will soon faceparticularly when entering the overgrownbuilding across the river that was oncethe local schoolnonowhattakes me back to my time as a teacherthe school hall not scarecrows what'screepy is if you don't look at themif you look at the floor or the ceilingandat the corner of your eyes you coulddelude yourself for their people andthen you look and you see 200 figurineslooking back at you dressed immaculatelywearing costumes they're holding fansand they've got hats they've got glassesmustaches beards the level of detail isincredible it really is like there'snothing tacky about this um the womanthat made each of these dolls did anincredible job i think it's pretty damncool but the guy on the chair is justcreeping me outit looks like he fell off the localbridge and smashed his legs inthis honestly looks better than a lot ofthe gymnasiums that i went to schoolwith himyeahit's better than a welsh gymnasium it isthatmy gym at school did not look this goodthey have ping pong tables over therefor gosh sake those are in mintcondition you get a pretty penny forthoseit's hard to put this atmosphere intowords but fortunately we have connor onhand with his eloquently composedinsights and unmatched commentaryi just feel sad it's like you know thecreepiness is worn off now and now ijustit's all set it's just you know someonecares this much about making these andwishing the town was once what it wasyou know i'm sure the person who madethese probably experience the town likethis right it's just really sad i don'tknow it's just i'm starting to feelquite sad actuallyi kind of want to just go homeit's really sadtake a shot every time connor says theword sadthis is so sadi object to this marriagei am the fatherof the baby i don't know which onethey do have red hair dude look like youthey look more like youthan they did like the husbandwhat can i say and get up to businessi don't know i mean i mean i'm britishso you know i'm cold i couldn't think ofdoing this i'd give up after the firstyou know trying to do someone's foot buti mean i don't understand people havethe energy to do iti'm already i'm tired just watchingchris walker because she's built like abag of milki don't know how to react to that idon't know what that meansyeahyou know i i don't want to be too harshyou know we've been driving for twohours now and every single town looksthe same you know it's very beautifulbut it's just really nothingdistinctive about any of the towns youcome in here you stop the car becauseyou want to know what's going on sofair enough well played you got me to befair connor this one over here lookslike you and your jojo suit this guyno he doesn't he definitely doesn'ti want a comparison this one connor herewhat do you think guys it's the samedefinitely[Music]leaving connor's scarecrow doppelgangerbehind we crossed the border over intokochi prefecture the last prefecturei've yet to visit in all of japanand after a quick change out of ourdrenched clothing we head over to thebustling hiromi market to try theregion's local iconic dish[Music]welcome to hirome market the busiestmost vibrant market in all of culturenow there's one thing in kochi they liketo eat and that is tataki like bonitofishbarbecue it's really strange it's kindof yeah it's barbecued on the edge butthe inside is very sort of juicy andmeaty and now we're gonna try it let mehave a shot see if it lives up to theheight stop talking and give me thefruit chrisit's really charred on the outside andthen in the middle it's just like anormal fish sushi it's so strange ihonestly think if you gave this tosomeone they didn't know what it was youcould probably convince me with steak itdoes taste like steak it's so strangeit's like steak with a fishy undertonetoo but it's really good like thebarbecue flavor the salt they put overit the rock salt one to them that's aneight or nine it's a solid nine i couldeat four of them i could eat all of thati got one plate because connor was likei can't do it i can't eat fish it thistime in the morning oh goshbut now he's got one still i will haveit all now i will take another onewe'll have another slidechris i hope you slept amazingly lastnight because tonight you're

oh that'spushing me over the edge a little bitbut i can't leave i just feel it'd be soawkward it's that's the only thingthat's stopping you from leaving is thatthere's a woman downstairs that you

_Jul0ViWlp0,This Sphere is in Vanilla Minecraft,2115528,114074,1137,spheres in minecraft possible or not i'mgonna push vanilla minecraft to itslimit to see if it's possible to make areal sphere in minecraft so last time wemade this circle and that video hasabsolutely blown up why not subscribeand keep it going i asked you guys ontwitter what to do next and the majorityof you said a sphere so what we did lasttime was we spawned an armor stand thatspun in circles and that armor standsspawned more armor stands below herewith blocks on their heads but what if iwas the armor stand instead we're gonnaplace down a repeating command block ohwhat's happening and we have thisexecute as ourselves the closest playerat ourselves anchored at our eyes sothat it looks out of our head instead ofour feet and we run the command tosummon an armor stand this shouldtheoretically be a pretty easy way tomake a sphere so i just look around imean i feel like this is technicallyworking let me turn this off that's apretty good first attempt but of coursethere's no way to make it like perfectand you're definitely going to double upon some spots and have more armor standsthan you need it's just going to bereally laggy so here i moved the circlething back over here whoops i moved thecircle thing back over here and i gotrid of the two extra ones because weonly need one layer of armor stands soinside of this command uh inside of thiscommand block you see how we turn thearmor stand horizontally i say insteadof just having him spin like thiswe should have him spin and slowly goupwards as he spins like that and theneventually over time that should makethe top half of a sphere this right hereis the uh the horizontal turn so for avertical turn let's do negativeuhprobably just likeone that might be too much let's do likepoint five maybe try negative point fivei wanted to break this guy and we'llturn this onand that isactuallydoing what i thought it wouldbut a bit too quickly what does thislook like i want to press this buttonwhat does that dothat's pretty interesting so this timelet's make it likeuhlike 0.3this is 2.1 this is probably fine thatseems like that might bea good amount actually that's probablygood enough let's stop thisbreak this guyand this looks cool let's turn it andthey only they don't turn on the y-axisnow i could of course just call it a dayand move on but i think we can get it alittle more smooth than that so we'llwant to execute this command as allentities of type armor stand within adistance of tens probably fine i'm goingto run the command to mess with the datawe're going to merge our new data intothe pre-existingentityof whatever armor stand it picks overhere and what we're going to change iswe're going to change the poseof the head to be this should be let'stry like 15and then zero zero and 15 should be theaxis we want and if i did this correctlythey should all be looking down okay ifyou can't tell they're all like kind ofsloped inwards like this but you see nowthe hard part is going to be to figureout how to get that to work at adifferent level for each one of thesebecause they all need to have their ownspecific rotation to look directly atthis block but then i thought of apretty interesting way to get them toturn their heads by making them copy myhead so apparently there's a bug inminecraft to where you can't actuallyget it to workunlesssomething about them has already beenchanged so it looks like they arefollowing my head but still not the axiswe want them to move on i mean this isthis is pretty cool too though what wehave to do is change the uh parametersinside of these rotations right here nowme moving left or right makes a move upand down and now me looking up and downshould make them look up and down andthat's the thing we want to change butthe problem is getting them all to workseparately and look at the correctdirection ooh this looks pretty coollook at that it's like a littleanimation that's pretty neat butactually what if i combine the turningof these with our original idea so thiscommand block summons the armor standabout three blocks in front of wherewe're looking this one just edits itvery slightly so that we can even runthe command because of the bug this onecopies our vertical head rotation to thearmor stand and then this one gets ridof the tag so that it doesn't do as muchmath so let's go up here and let's tryit out it's a bit oddfor sure it's not exactlywhat i'm looking for it's kind of fun tocolor with though you know it's notactually that bad it actually ohyeah it is working right okay it justlooked weird from in there that iscorrectso technically this is a way you can doit i guess uh but they're not turningthey're only turning on that directionokay added another command block in themiddle that rotates them towards us sothen let's actually kill all these andnow they should remainnope still diagonal all right so i don'tknow what i was doing wrong with thisrotation one but i literally just copiedit from that command block so let's giveit a test and we shouldokay yeah they are rotatingokay i think i guess that is typoedsomething i don't they're like rotatinga little bit late it's weird but i meani guess i can draw a sphere like thisstarted lagging severely and i had tokill some for performancebut uh this isn't exactly as smooth as ithought it would be what if we go backto this one let me get rid of the oldentities what if we just change this toa very small numbera tenth the size and we run it like thisand then there's just so many armorstands that you can't even see the gapsin between let's see how that works outall right so um i'm currentlyon 6 fps that was a bit too many i thinkokay so i changed a little bit we'redown to like 20 fps but maybe this willlook a little bit better if i flick thisthat is marginally better yes this thingis just way too laggy though but youknow maybe armor stands just weren't theway to go so i tried minecarts i am nowsummoning a minecart with an offsetblock like this and then i want to havea scoreboard that spins it in a circleexcept i want to spin the minecartthis way instead of the way it's goingand the reason i want to do that isbecause if i can make a bunch ofvertical circles i can just slowly spinthem and make very nice spheres oh stopdoing it what happened a second ago itwas like dipping back oh the second istarted recording it stoppedohthere you go you see it did it a secondumwhy is this so unreliable what'shappening if i flick this make it alittle bit higher it did back a secondwhat so if i can't get this to work i'mgonna have to try something a littlemore manual but i'm still gonna try toautomate it so what we can do is hardcode it and so we have all theseindividual command blocks that make thisfull circle except we need this manythis many more times all slightly turnedhorizontally to make a full sphere outof this and plus if you manage to touchthis[Music]i tried to automate it so that wheneverthis happens you can just turn it bythis a few degrees but as you can seehereuhthey all just kind of collect togetherand you can't just change one rotationwithout changing all of them so it'ssadly looking like the only way to makea good sphere in minecraft that's notsuper blocky like this one over here isto hard code the entire thing yourselfuh well i did that i sure did do thatand if we press this button we nowsuddenly have a sphere in minecraft butthe coolest part is if you go inside youget the disco ball of mine carts butthere's only one thing left to dopush the disco ball and crash the worldfor eternityoh[Music]i just kind of turned to a school busmaybe but there is one thing no onesuspected and that's that i would turnthe world into a sphere all i'm going tosay is my next video is going to be alittle revolutionary so you might wantto subscribe why don't you check outthis video on how you use chest wrong inminecraft and trust me you

LXLmSz4Wb9w,Full Cabin Tour  Before & After 1 Year of Renovations,388719,30946,283,"hey everyone we're eamon and 
bec and this is our cabin  after years of living full time in our van 
and traveling the world we finally borrowed  enough money from the bank to buy some land 
this cabin was built in the 70s and sits on  three acres of land with over 600 feet of 
waterfront come on in we'll show you aroundso we moved in last october not 
really knowing what to expect  and we've done a ton of renovations 
in the past year in less than a year  so everything you're about to see is pretty 
much new except for this porch obviously  so right when you walk in you've got one washroom 
on either side the only thing we actually really  changed inside this space is we got rid of this 
old double sink that they used to have in this  area and added the washer and dryer i never 
thought i'd be so happy to have my own laundryinside the little laundry room there's lots of 
nice storage and a hand washing sink and then  private bathroom and shower shower is pretty small 
but in the winter time it's nice to have both  options we've got a little laundry hamper here oh 
that's where we keep the sheets so the old owners  renovated this beautifully with all the wood and 
honestly i only noticed this about two months agowho would have thunk some privacy in the bathroom 
fancy as anything but why would you ever need  that welcome to the ladies bathroom this is 
where we always keep the seat down we have  candles going it always smells nice and another 
key feature of this bathroom is the full bathtub  though in the summer months we prefer to use the 
outdoor shower which we will show you in a second  in both bathrooms we've attached these little 
bidets which are money absolute game changers  if you come visit we make you try it out because 
a lot of people are weirded out by bananas but  i'm weirded out by those who don't use bidets i 
agree coming from a girl who used to poop into  a bucket and a composting toilet and lots has 
changed when we first moved in we thought having  both bathrooms down there might be a bit odd but 
honestly when you're all hanging out up here it's  really nice to go into your own private area to 
use them today use the bidet play with the bidet  of course use of the bidet is complimentary 
very nice very nice good kitchen here we are  definitely my favorite part 
of the kitchen is the massive  delicious solid maple counter it just makes 
me happy every time i walk by i kind of just  glide my hand along here and i'm loving it we 
also love the color we went with this is all  ikea kitchen would not recommend installing 
it yourself it was a bit of a nightmarei don't get it i know i'm just i'm losing my mind 
this is bananas we shelled out and got the ge cafe  series appliances big thumbs up love the range 
love the dishwasher the fridge is on back order  and has been for nine months so every good tour 
shows off your fridge right oh no no we did not  clean out our fridge or freezer oh i wasn't 
ready for this uh we like to keep a lot of  frozen berries on stock lots of vegan perogies 
i don't know we got leftover pizza in hereyou're not  oh my gosh something else i've seen on instagram 
in like really fancy kitchens is pot colorsso we put one of those in along the island we 
got lots of extra storage this one's kind of  cool we put this drawer here so when you're 
chopping you've got your compost right herelittle things like that that make your life a 
lot easier speaking of making your life easier  after eight years together four bands traveling 
the world what a luxury we've got a dishwasher so  this is probably my favorite edition of the house 
and then this is our little coffee bar nook area  blender gets a lot of use every day coffee machine 
every day snack drawer every day you'll notice  that we don't have a proper desk set up because we 
enjoy working in all different spaces of the house  so we kind of utilize the pantry as a desk we have 
electrical run through here so we charge all of  our gear we have a printer printer ink pens more 
snacks yes i'll never forget walking into this  place and thinking it was so closed in and dark 
and i said to eamon i'll move in if you promise  me we'll put a wall of windows at the front so 
we put a wall of windows and it looks incredible  through the entire floor we laid vinyl planks and 
this has been amazing because it doesn't matter  if you've got wet feet or you spill something in 
the kitchen it's just plastic flooring and lasts  forever and this is the living room so the big 
game changer that we did here when we moved in  the wood burning stove was actually in the 
center of the room which didn't really make  sense because you're always staring away from the 
water so moving that was bob's call great call  and now your focal point is out towards the lake 
honestly i remember when we moved in and i thought  we had nothing because we've been living in a van 
forever and then we filled the shelf in a day so  all of our travel books eamon's axe in case anyone 
comes to visit that was not welcome of coursethe ukewe're doing a cabin tourall right let's spare everyone almost 
forgot to show you uh my girlfriend alexa  how you going there sweetheart sorry 
i don't know that she doesn't speak  australian um but that's pretty key so 
you can go like alexa turn on the heatit's set to heat takes a while but so we actually 
put in all new hvac throughout the entire place  that was a big expense but we lived in this 
throughout the entire winter uninsulated  just with that wood burning stove and it was 
freezing kind of cute for the first month but  really romantic yeah for the first month yeah 
we don't have ac yet but maybe next summer  at this point in the tour you might be wondering 
why are we getting a tour when your cabin's not  done and to be honest it never really will 
be but eamon and i are ready to close this  chapter because we are ready to 
get on the road and travel againafter a year and a half of living in one place 
we are so excited to get back on the road  and if you're like us looking to maybe book some 
flights hotels car rentals we're excited to share  with you hopper hopper is a free travel 
app that's available on android and ios  that uses data driven technology to find the best 
prices for you there are no hidden fees no stress  just accurate predictions and travel deals we're 
currently using hopper to book our flights back  to morocco to rescue our abandoned van trinity 
we're so excited to get back there and when you  compare hopper's deals to other booking platforms 
we're saving up to 40 on these flights the app  is really quite simple to use and actually has a 
color-coded calendar which shows you the cheapest  days to fly on and because we're flexible with our

link to get that awesome deal and let us know in  the comments where you're planning on going we're 
so excited to get back to trinity back to the tour  this guy's eating pizza again he's unbelievable 
didn't you eat just an hour ago i just want to  remain giving the tour my full attention so i 
just need two more minutes right off the kitchen  space we have our guest bedroom so in here the 
floor continues through we put all new drywall  re-paneled the ceiling actually ended up 
reinstalling these shelves and then the  biggest part of this bedroom was taking one of the 
windows that were on the front wall of the cabin  and moving it into here so we have lots of natural 
light the bedrooms are small but honestly all you  need in a room is a comfy bed and we got that 
and a water ski well of course the water skias we were wrapping up in this room eamon just 
mentioned that it's quite boring and needs some  artwork yeah it's like white totally agree with 
but i don't want to rush it and we're going  back to morocco and i think it'd be so amazing 
to have pieces from around the world that we can  now actually collect for home so not russian no 
just outside this bedroom you might see a little  doggie dish we don't have a dog but we have 
lots of doggie friends so we have a doggy dishwe actually redid these stairs by painting 
them white and then adding a jute runner all  the way up and then we arrive in the loft aka 
the hostel where we can sleep up to 10 people  if any of you are og's and can remember back to 
this space when we first saw it i think there  were at least six single beds here they almost 
looked like coffins it was very creepy and we've  replaced those with two queen-sized beds and 
we had these custom cushions made so that when  we're watching tv on our big projector you're 
kind of propped up as though you're on a couch  yeah the smell has also improved drastically from 
when we moved in drastically and then on this side  of the loft this is probably the second best guest 
bedroom suite bed because you do have a little bit  more privacy so we got this cool like privacy 
divider although it's basically see-through but  it gives you like a little sense of privacy and 
then we've got uh different options so sometimes  we set this up differently we've got the queen 
and the single and not a lot of other furniture  right now but in the dead of winter ayman and i 
were looking for fun things to build and create  enter the hammock now the problem with the hammock 
is we haven't actually created a door or anything  any easy way to get in so right now 
you literally have to step up and over  yeah and then kind of fall into the hammock which 
is always you know its own holy shoot that almost  came off what's happening i'm terrified trust in 
the process man trust the process okay holy shoot  i'm not getting out this robot this looks 
relaxing this is a relaxing experience huh  heart's beating so fast okay come on bud we got a 
tour to film oh this is super comfy tour the filmcome on in this is where we sleep uh it's got 
an amazing energy in here we actually installed  the sliding door uh right off the deck so 
when you wake up in the morning just boom  hammer outside give it a big stretch i've never 
done that or in the middle of the night i just  found out that you actually go out here to 
pee actually i do you notice it's quite the  walk then you gotta hit the stairs and get the 
washer so i'll just whip it right off the deck  and it's beautiful i actually really i used 
to hate that i peed a lot in the middle of  the night but now i look forward to it almost 
because it's like just me time quiet the starsbabe i didn't realize we were going to be 
opening up all our drawers yeah i think this  is relatable i really do they also have storage 
underneath the bed so so yeah that's huge these  are pretty key yeah and then whenever beck 
grabs a pair of socks she goes like thisand then all wake up in the middle of an angle 
literally done it 25 times this is the most  unexpected room in the house i originally 
thought the screened-in porch would be for  dining a big beautiful table but we turned it into 
a gym y'all get after it get after it bro what yesjust one you should really stretch that 
sort of yeah but we love having a gym out  here it's been so great after many many 
years on the road and going to gyms and  just like makeshifting our workouts to have 
a set schedule it's one of my favorite things  that came with the cabin it's an old general 
electric fan look how long it takes to startcome on come on yeah it's a metal blade it makes 
a lot of noise but it's like guys that like rustic  gym pod and then this fridge is really jokes 
too it's like a classic beer fridge so when it  kicks on which is on right now you can hear it and 
when it kicks on all the lights in the house dim  from the screen and porch we come out onto our 
illegal deck yes i know a lot of you are asking  about our permit situation we are still in works 
with the township hopefully everything will work  itself out but we'll show you around our illegal 
space they haven't made us tear it down yet  this is the outdoor kitchen this was my favorite 
project to build because obviously that's why i  bought this place to spend time outside we've 
got the barbecue and soon to be pizza oven  you can just imagine it because that's what i've 
been doing it's also on back order for six months  the barbecue we actually ran a line 
directly to the big propane tank  we've got four monster propane tanks so that's 
how we heat the house living out in the woods  you'll get used to living with a lot of other 
critters in the sink here which is dennis  i think he's a doc spider he's always there a 
little bit more storage underneath and then that  flows right on to the outdoor shower we've got 
two waterfall shower heads we've even got a doggie  shower you think we have a dog coming soon coming 
soon you gotta open this and you gotta turn overdid you know that was on yeah amenso what are you doing why would you do that 
why did you do that this is our gift from  santa this year our brand new hot tub i 
would open it to show you but i'm afraid  that the cameraman might push me in after 
what i pulled in the shower there no noso this is super sweet it's amazing in winter 
we've been stargazing in summer if you're in  the market for hot tub and you're looking 
online don't be fooled by the term water  feature as i was sold on it i was picturing 
like a fountain like shooting water outthat's it and our property is slightly elevated 
so building this staircase down to the water was  a big job but well worth it we've got kind of all 
these little landings so it if you need a break  you can take one bob usually stops here this is 
the bob chair oh i was wondering where that chair  came from and why it's here the bob chair so we 
got quite a few stairs down to this next larger  platform where we are manifesting a beautiful 
cedar sauna one day right in this corner wouldn't  that be amazing and from the larger platform there 
are two more sets of stairs down to the water  this is a really fun project we 
actually built this floating dock using  30 massive plastic barrels and it's where we 
actually gather a ton and spend a lot of our time  we've got all day sun jump off the dock 
and just sit and enjoy this last section  of stairs was interrupted by the building 
inspector so eventually we would like to do  like a little bit more of a permanent solution 
maybe a larger platform that accesses the dock  but we're just grateful that we're able to get to 
the water this season this is our pontoon boat the  couch of the seas it's definitely the best way to 
explore the waters all right well that's the main  dock we actually have a second one on the other 
side it's a bit of a hike we'll get there soonbefore we head to the second doc slash 
boat house i'm going to show you the shed  this is where beck's kicked 
me out bring all my tools  and as i mentioned you always have 
roommates charleston lives here hi buddycharleston's the resident chippy he moved 
into this corner about a month ago and  it's kind of my fault everything's 
kind of open still at the rafters  i know he's pretty cute i might let him 
live the winter we haven't decided yet  but yeah this is where i hang out 
and uh smash some tools aroundhow sick is this careful yeah dude 
you do some damage with this puppy  we do have a security system 
here but i'm telling youback stay back haters stay back don't leave that 
comment when we first moved in this shed was full  of junk and then we cleaned it absolutely spotless 
and not that it's junk in there but it's full  again what this is very oregon i would say this 
is pretty organized yeah it's pretty beautiful  wait till you see the basement oh my gosh the 
basement so as beck mentioned we are sitting  on three beautiful acres and we really haven't 
done much with the property off the left here  so look out for ticks and snakes and spiders 
and chipmunks oh geez so i wanted to take you  guys down to an area we like to call vex bay 
we kind of keep this past a little trimmed  or aim and does because one day we'd love to 
be able to build another cabin down this wayso welcome to beck's bay everyone this is our 
beautiful sort of the end of our property line  it's really nice and level lots of beautiful 
birch trees and then we have a beautiful  little bay another favorite part about  this cabin is that we can host people and as 
you've seen we have a few guest bedrooms but we  love to use our van as an alternative funky oh the 
van gets parked here just next to the porta pottythis has not been used yet but it's got the 
original tp from 1972. and that smell from 1972.the van is a perfect guest cabin because it's 
completely self-contained the composting toilet  is in working condition and it actually 
sleeps two people very comfortably and  if we need to we could squeeze a third so 
while the van hasn't had as many adventures  this summer it's seen a lot of guests 
including some not-so-welcome onesoh my god those mouse traps suck dude  he actually took the tape off the peanut 
butter let's see his poo everywhere oh nodon't worry guess we'll clean it before you come 
this loop has worked out really well you might  have thought we planned this but we didn't this 
is our well so this drops like many many feet  into the ground and that's where we get our fresh 
drinking water and then we actually also hooked  up a lake water intake so if we need to water the 
garden fill up the hot tub right out of the lake  boat house boat house you want to tell them 
about this path we did yeah this spring we  actually pulled out a lot of big rocks and 
stumps and things you would stub your toe on  laid some wood chips down and just finish the 
path a little bit more safely gently gently  and this path leads to our boathouse boat shed 
where we keep our kayaks eamon's hip waders  and not much else life jackets life 
jacket i kind of like it in here it's  a little bit creepy but sometimes i hang 
out here when beck's asking me to do stuff  this is a pretty amazing potential here for 
a beach it just needs some tlc but i guess  we technically have a beach and i guess we 
technically have two sea dews not technically  we have two seaters this is something we bought 
back in january we didn't get them till now butyeah we did it we bought two sieges  no one to blame except for lee and lee only 
she made us do it and we're not upset about itthis was eamon's christmas 
gift from my parents this year  but it's where i spend most 
of my time perfecting my swingoh catch me on a golf course near youlet me show you the basement so we loaded up with 
four i think they're 100 liters i could be wrong  it sounds no it doesn't sound like enough 400 
liters anyway i have no idea how big they are  but last winter we actually ran out in 
the middle of the season now we weren't  insulated so we're hoping that this 
would get us through the entire winter  because sometimes there's issues with the refill 
truck getting through there's supposedly that much  snow and the basement this is another space in the 
house where we really cleaned it up really nice  and then just re-junked it up 
eamon had this as a little workshop  really beautifully done and now it's sort of 
just the overflow of things that eamon finds  at the dump and brings home yeah right and then 
this is our kind of water utility room so we put  in the brand new furnace this year so we had all 
the ducting ran throughout the house that was a  big job we've got our water heater our accumulator 
and then we are on the well so it's hard water so  we put in a water softener when we moved in this 
was all a dirt floor basement and i think there  were some snakes and rats and mice living in here 
so what we did is we laid a plastic poly floor  and right up to each side of the wall and 
then had a spray foam guy come in and seal  the entire area so you can see the floor is now 
sealed with the concrete floor that was a great  move because we haven't had a critter in here 
since what is left what else can we show you  well really all that's left to do is to thank 
you guys we've had this unbelievable ride where  essentially we've been able to post a video 
every single week for the last year and call  that a job we truly are living our dream and 
without every single one of you tuning in  and showing support this wouldn't be possible a 
few years ago this was all just a dream we were  two kids who moved into a van everyone thought 
we were a little crazy selling tea across canada  and we always dream that one day we'd have a home 
base that we could come to that we absolutely love  and this is it hopefully this just encourages 
you to continue living your best life get out  there chase your dreams because they are totally 
possible and we hope to support you guys in all of  your adventures just as you have for us that's 
essentially a wrap on this cabin series we're  super excited to share some new content with you 
maybe some international travel and as always  we'll see you sunday and go call someone you 
love and tell them you love them we love you guysi do i love them i know i love them too i haven't 
met a lot of you but i would love to one day i  can't wait for meetups to come back i know we

RTR9Y9DZNJ4,Mocking up the interior (Rebuilding Tally Ho  EP105),319671,28805,121,[Music]hi my name's leo and i'm a boat builderand a sailor and i'm on a mission torebuild and restore this 111 year oldclassic sailing yacht tallyhonow this week's video is going to be allabout planning the interioraccommodation so we're going to belooking at a lot of drawings both oldand new and mocking up some stuff insidethe boat one of the important parts ofthe interior is the bulkheads so i'mgoing to be explaining those but thefirst thing i'm going to do is get holdof some timber to make the bulkheads andpatrick and rowan are going to bemilling that up[Music]so the timber that we're using forbulkheads is douglas fir douglas fir isa soft wood it's grown locally to herewhich is nice the reason we're usingdouglas fir is its strength and itsweight and the ratio of those thingsbecause it's now very important thatwe're careful about how much weight weadd to the boat because we have toconsider the center of gravity and therighting moment of the boat and i'vealready used a lot of very heavyhardwoods in the structure of the boatthe douglas fir we're using is cortisoneclear tight grained so it's going to bestrong it's going to be stable it'sgoing to be relatively rot resistant andit's going to be light all of which areimportant for bulkheads which need tohave some strength but they're going tomostly be under compression so theydon't need to be crazily strong now thebulkheads are going to be made out oftongue and groove and they're going tobe laminated with two layers which aregoing to both be diagonal and that isthe arrangement which gives the moststrength to a bulkhead in thecompression loads that it's under thereason i'm using solid timber and notplywood is mainly because i'm justtrying to keep it as traditional aspossible but there are advantages tousing solid timber if you have a problemwith fresh water or with rot in plywoodit tends to track and travel around thesheet pretty quickly in solid timber ifit does rot it's more easy to replaceone or two boards at a time it's also alot nicer to work with and the finishedresult is much much nicer as well evenif the timber is paintedyou can tell if it's a solid timber andit just gives a much nicer feel andatmosphere than a sheet of[Music][Applause][Music]plywood well we're just mailing downabout uh we're chipping away at about700 board feet of uh douglas fir aren'twe rowanyeah we arethey were originally roughs on boards atlike an inch thick and we've broughtthem down to like three quarters of aninchso that we don't get as many splintersbut i could i still got a lot ofsplinters on the sides of the boardshave you yeah that's tough dude it'stough good thing you're super strongjust like me yeah i just put all myenergy into squeezing the splinter outwith my telekinesis uh-huh cleo'sshaking his head again oh my god i'mgoing to spend four hoursthree minute long interviewsand we just keep feeding him dialogueman that's terrible dude i bet we coulddo a whole episode just us talkingbackyou know don't forget to smash that likebutton and subscribe and subscribe clickthe little bell icon continueconsider joining the patreon too that'sa good one yeah atwww.patrick's patreon.gov[Music][Music][Music]myso[Music][Music][Music][Music]so there are a few places in the boatyard which do food and they're all verygood but we've fallen into the routineof coming here every day to get our takeout lunch this is the marina cafe butit's affectionately known as jen's placebecause it's owned by a really reallylovely woman called jenhello my name is jennifer takaki and ihave the marina cafe which is down herein boathaven in port townsend washingtonit's a no menu cafe and we kind we havea farm and we grow things and we i justbake itmost of our customers are boat workersdown here which isuper love i'm super honored that theycome and eat here every day and how hardthey workfor lunches i make stromboli which isthe hot italian baked sandwiches likerolled up pizza i just make one lunchspecial and i make about 50 of them andthen that's it and everyone goes back toworkall right thank youyeah i come here as often as i can andyeah i love these people they're just soold school i there was a rack a wholerack of ious before the pandemicso there's such a element of trust andjen says they they're based onfriendship here i love that if youforget your wallet hey pay me tomorrowone time i remember in particular herdad wally was working here i didn't havemuch money on me and he made my kid askher a beautiful lunch and i said wallywhat do i owe you and he said nothingoscar just do something nice forsomebody so oscar's now down in colombiaworking for an ambulance service helpingpeople on the streets of columbia and uhbut i hope that message is getting outto the worldand i thank him for ityou'rewelcome you're ready for lunch tim youneed a coca-cola[Music]so ron and patrick have been milling upthe bulkhead stock so it needed a lot ofmachining done to it so uh planed uhdown to thickness three quarters of aninchjoined on one side then ripped on thetable sawto our desired widthand then we're doing a tng v-grooveboard um so that's tongue and groove umand then uh where they meet is a has aslight chamfer on both sides on eachboard umcreating a really nice aesthetic a nicepleasing look inside the boat for ourbulkheads our tng boards are going to becross-land at a slight diagonalso that's a really traditional look uhwith the v-grooveand so most of the bulkheads in the boatare going to be uhare are going to look that way um someare going to get cheesing on top of themsome raised panels and you know once wefigure out our actual interior what wewhat aesthetic we're going for[Music][Music]so the guys have been really busymilling timber and doing a very good jobof that meanwhile me and pete have beenspending a lot of time still working onfairing the deck i thought we werepretty much done at the end of the lastvideo but fairing does have a way ofjust stretching out i haven't reallyfilmed any of it because you saw it allin the last video the other thing thati've been doing is working on the planfor the inside of the boat theaccommodation the layout now i do havecopies of the original plans for theinside of the boat but i don't feel anystrong sort of moral responsibility tofollow them exactlybecause it's really the hull of the boatthat makes it what it is that's the sortof designer's legacy and what gives theboat its characterand its performance and everything elseimportant about it in general boats overthe period of their lifetime will oftenhave their interior layout changedpossibly several times according to whatthey're used for and what the needs areof the particular owners and we do knowthat throughout taliho's life theinterior was changed many times now havea quick look at the original drawingsand we can see thatthere's this very large onus cabin sortof right in the middle of the boat thattakes up a lot of spaceand then the galley is just sort oftucked into this little corridor on theport sideand then you've got crew quarters upforwardso it's really designed uh as a boatwhere you would have a paid working crewwho would be you know doing the cookingand stuff hidden away in the dark up inthe frontand then the sort of more opulent ownersarea um which takes up a lot of room ingeneral the use of space is not thatefficient um which would have been fineas the boat was intended to be used forsort of you know short cruises and daysailing and fishingbut for a boat that's going to be livedon and sailed around the world it wouldreally be a shame not to use the spaceand the volume of the boat moreefficiently so what i've decided to dois to changesome aspects of the accommodation whilestill keeping some features of theoriginal layoutand trying to replicate the originalstyle and design and constructiontechniques as much as possible so if youlook at the new drawings you can seethat we've still got a cabinon port side aft we've kept that in thesame place but we've made it a littlebit longer and we've put a double bunkin there we've still got a pretty largesort of crew cabin focused on area upforwardbut we've put the head forward on theport side where the galley used to beand we bought the galley into the saloonto make it a much more open communalarea which is a much more sort of modernway where thecooks are not separate from you know therest of the crew that's the main changewe've made and then where the head usedto be on the starboard side aft i'vechanged that into a corridor leading aftinto an engine room and in that corridorthere is a pilot berth so just onesingle bunk outboard of that corridorand then that engine room is going togive really good access to the engineand all the systems which is a reallyreally nice luxury to have the originallayout also didn't have a chart tablewhich in my experience is essential forlong distance cruising so we've added achart tablejust at the bottom of thecompanionway at the bottom of the stepsthere on the starboard side with afull-size table that can take afull-size charge so i'll be able to dotraditional navigation there it'll alsoprobably be a useful desk for makingvideos and stuff like thatso one of the really exciting thingsabout moving to port townsend is beingso much closer to a sailing community soi've been hoping to get hold of a littleboat that we can use just to get out onthe water for funand to teach the crew some more sailingskills so just the other day i purchasedthis small boatfrom the northwest maritime centrethey're a really awesome organizationthey do a lot of work toencourage and educate about all sorts ofmaritime skills and history they havesome really really great programs thatare focused on getting women and girlsout on the water and involved in boatbuilding as well which i think is reallyimportant so do check them out andsupport them if you can so i just boughtthis boat from them it's a flying scotthat's the name of the class which is a19 foot sort of racing slash day sailingdinghy they were originally designed in1958 i think and this one was built inthe 70s so we've just done a little bitof work getting it ready to sail ithasn't been used in a few years onething we do still have to do with thisboat is decide on a name so we're goingto try and come up with a good name thisweekand i might even be able to convincenina to do some lettering on the boatwhich is something she's very good at[Music][Music]oh yeah you need a depth sounderwe got oneyeahso we're gonna hit another hole throughthe water[Music][Music]in this new layout we've got a wetlocker underneath the companionway andthat will be heated by the engine soyou'll be able to put wet weather gearunder there really easily and it'll dryit out now we've still got a pretty bigsaloon area but instead of having acouch on either side of the boat reallyfar away we've turned it into one sortof l-shaped couch and we've moved thewood burning stove from the aft of thesaloon to the forward end of the saloonbecausewhere the flu comes out of the deckhaving that aft can cause a lot ofproblems with the boom up forward we'vegot a really versatile area this is acabin with a door that closes off sothis could be used as a double cabinit's got a double bunk in it underneathit there's a single bunk if this isn'tbeing used as a double cabin if it'sjust been used for general crewaccommodation that's another bunk andthen there's another bunk on port sideover the top of a workbench it's goingto be a fold out bunk or a fold downbunk could have up to four peoplesleeping in that folksville area or itcould just be acabin for a couple now the originalaccommodation didn't have any doubleberths any double bunks which kind ofsucks if you're gonna be having anycouples on board or cruising with apartner and it actually only had twopermanent bunks for the guests all therest were fold out cots now the newlayout it's got two double berths whichyou know it's really nice way to cruiseis with two couples um and then it'salso got another three single berths aswell and then there's the saloon couchas well so that can sleep up to eightpeople on all those beds if necessary soi've really with this layout try to makean interior that'sgonna be versatile for long distancecruising with you know just two peopleor three or four and really comfortablein that scenario but can also be usedjust as effectively for racingwhere you need a lot of crewso[Music]so[Music]day[Music][Music][Music]so the guys have now finished milling upthe douglas fir for the bulkheads thegrain on this stuff is just lovelyreally tight all cord sawn so it's goingto be really stable and strong we'rejust leaving these stacked up underneaththe boat for now and so what we're goingto do now i'm happy with the drawings iswe're actually going to mock those upinside the boat so we can actually seehow it really looks now it does take abit of time and quite a lot of materialsto mock up the interior of a boathopefully we can reuse almost all thosematerialsbut it is a really really important stepbecause you know no matter how carefulyou are with designing uh in the in thedrawing phasethere's no substitute to really actuallystanding inside a space and seeing howit will be to interact with that spacephysically[Music][Music]so[Music]so[Music]here[Music]uhhow muchhow much weight can go on thatis a good questionit's just clampslook at that come on come on come onpeteythe master cabin back come on i'll justhang for mei'll get my a little bit of my weightback as welllook at that the whole squad's togetheryou gotta have tea time here next yeahlook at this boat we gotnice yeah coolthere's two two port lights yeah andthena port light into thefootwell of thecockpit ohyeah so right thereyeah great[Music]so we've only really just startedmocking out the interior we've just putthe sole down throughout most of theboat and we've put in a few bulkheadshere and there but it's actually reallyinteresting and really nice to see thisspace start to take shape i was actuallyexpecting that once we put the sawboards and bulkheads in that this spaceinside the boat would feel smaller butfunnily enough it actually feels biggerto me nowi guess just because it's a much moreusable space and it's much easier tomove around in itand sectioning it off uh doesn't make itfeel cramped like i kind of thought itwould it makes it feel more like a boatas we know a boat should be is a spacethat you can move around and usehey jentwice in one day huhyou're gonna be gone that's rightfive todayhi guys what's for lunch today nice andloudone two three[Music]i want a high five[Music][Music]let's see if it was[Music]filming we aremaking theforward bulkhead ofthis umlittle double berth up here singlesinglesingle berthwe'll get that in post righthey leah what are you doingi'm filmingall right we gotta redo that pattywalked right in front of the right frontof the camerapete what are you doingwhat are you doingi'll be quickwe put wooden boat all right we're donehereuh we're doing arough mock-up of the interior of theboat right now um and so we've laid whatour sole is going to be the flooringinside the boat it's called the soleit's in a few stages actually there's acouple step ups anyway so we've laid atemporary sole downand we've put in these bulkheadsa thwart ship sectional walls thatseparate the boat into their cabins andsaloon saloon and salon salonso anyway that's what we're doing we'redoing as much of the mock-up as we canof what the interior is going to be likei'm doing woodworking weldingwiththis hot glue gunremember not to use up all that hot gluebecause we got to put the ballast keyalong sohey you said that joke yesterdaybut it wasn't on camerathat was gold bro come onwe need thatyoutube needs that[Music][Music][Music]um so hi nina again um today i paintedstrombolii've been trying to get into boatlettering more andi learned a lot of things from this onewe're at the pub one night after workand uh trying to figure out a name forthis new boatand we umwe're trying to figure out some type oflike thing we have in common or somepoint of like communityandi think we all shouted out at kind ofthe same time but we forgot what it wascalled for a second we're like thosethings that we eat at lunch the from thejensbutanyway so yeahwehave uh had a lot of fun times onstromboliand umtoday we decided toput her ongive her a nameone of those things[Music]nice way to go budlook at that[Music][Music]so right at the front of the boat herewe've got the foxel and in the originalplan this was a sort of crewaccommodation for the paid crewand i've kind of kept it as trueaccommodation but i made it a little bitmore versatile so this is going to be aforward cabin i guess and it's got adouble bunk here with a single bunkunderneath it and then on the port sidethere's a single bunk which is going tofold up or slide away somehow i'm notexactly sure yet with a work benchunderneath it so the idea here is thatif you are cruising with two couples saythis could be a private double cabinwith a double bunk here and then lots ofstorageor if you're racing and you've got a lotof crew you could have three or evenfour crew members sleeping in thisforward cabin whoever ends up sleepingin here there's gonna be a lot ofstorage in this area too sotraditionally all the unused sails arestored in the folk sale so they'd comedown the forward hatch here and there'sactually going to be a small laddercoming down here as well so you can getin and out of this hatch and then thesails might be stored on any unusedbunks or they may be stored up forwardhere there's going to be some really bigdeep shelves up forward here and thenthe hanging locker here but there'sgonna be another huge locker here whichmay have shelves in it and that'll beused for storing people's gear or sailsor tools or whatever there's also gonnabe storage under the workbench probablyfor tools and materials and then thechain from thecapstone is going to come down aroundhere somewhere it's going to come down aspurling pipe and be stored underneaththe sole boards so looking off from thebow it's a little bit hard to see what'sgoing on but here on the port side isthe bunk with the workbench underneathit on the side side here we've got thedouble bunk small double and the singleunderneath it big locker on port sidehere and then going back and we've gotthe doorway here into the head so i'mstanding now inside the head thebathroom so there'll be a door here thisis the mast and up there's the bow ofthe boat the folk sawand in here there'll be a sink here somecabinets the toilet will be here andthere'll be a shower here i think nowobviously this is a small space whencompared to a regular bathroom in ahouse or something but actuallyespecially compared to how it looks onthe drawings and you know some otherheads i've been in on smaller boats thisfeels surprisingly roomy in here there'splenty of room to move around it's gonnabe quite a bit of storage in here andunder here um and it should be a fairlynice head okay so now we're in thecentral part of the boat lookingforwards so here's the mast the headbathroom is right here where i just wasso this is the saloon or salon that canbe said or spelt in either way and thenon this side we have the galley kitchenso there's going to be cabinets orhanging lockers up here they may notcome as far down as this they may justcome partially down and then thiscounter space may go further outboardpossibly right up to the frames going tohave a sink herea stove hob here on this side there'sgoing to be a heating stove either awood burner or possibly diesel or somecombination of the two if that existsand then there'll be a big dining tablehere with the l shaped seat around itnow in some ways i would prefer to havea wrap around galley because it's reallynice to cook in in heavy weatherbut of course you have to make somecompromisesthis is a very space efficient way oflaying out the galley and it's enabledus tohave more bunks and still have thisdecent sized saloon here so i think totry and make this galley safer and nicerto work in i'm going to have a fewthings to lean back on while you'reactually using the galley so maybe somekind of rail that comes down from themastand then the table will be right hereand there'll probably be a bench seat onthis side possibly that slides in andout but locks in place and that'll behopefully a high back bench of some kindthat you can lean back on and sort offeel secure in the galley if you'recooking in heavier weather these are alljust ideas at the moment they couldevolve and changeas i figure this out and as i might mockup a few more things in here so nowlooking aft in the same spaceyou can see thel shape of this sort of seti here ofcourse the table is not here yet but iprobably will put it inthegalley comes to here there's the hob thecooker and then this is going to be abig chart table so there'll be a bedthat the face is aft here so they'll getinand sit like this so it'd be a big tableslash desk here which will be used fornavigation probably have someinstruments around here as well butit'll also be a really useful desk forvideo editingor writing or anything like that that ihave to do above me of course there'sgoing to be a huge skylight hatch sothis whole area is going to be reallybright this will be the main socializinghanging out area of the boatyour food will be made here drinks wemade here and hopefully you'll be ableto sit a lot of people around this tablehopefully at least eight and thenfurther outboard on that side of theboat there'll be some bookshelves andprobably a lot of the structure of theboat will be exposed as well so rightnow i'm sitting on the companionwaysteps so you'll walk down thiscompanionway and then on the port sidehere's the doorway into the double cabinand then on the starboard side here's adoorway into the engineering passage andthe pilot berthand then looking aft obviouslyeventually you won't be able to seethrough here this will be uh solid witha couple of bulkheads butthat's where the engine will be that bigcardboard box and then in between theengine and this these steps there'll bea big wet locker which is accessedthrough here and that'll be where youhang wet weather gear and stuff to dryout and that'll be heated by the engineway back there you can see the lazarettebulkhead now the lazarette is basicallyjust a big locker right at the stern ofthe boat that is accessed from the deckso you won't be able to get through thatbulkhead at all inside the boat butthere's a hatch on the deck and soyou'll be able to get down into that andthat'll be where a lot of stuff isstored probably fenders lines thingslike that maybe some sales that sort ofthing this is thedoorway coming from the saloon here andfrom the companionway and so i'll comeinto here this will be a pilot berth andthis is a passage into the engine roomherenowright now you can see through here butyou won't be able to finally there'll bea bulkhead here the engine will be downthere and then this is going to be awet locker for wet weather gear oiliesand stuff and it'll be underneath thecompanionway steps there'll be a doorhereinto the engine roomand thenthis will bethe space where you can work on theengine there'll be a lot of storage ofuh engine components and stuff and thenalso a lot of systems stuff in here sobatteries and charge controllers andstuff like that then there'll be dieseltanks up herethe cockpit will be coming down here sothis space in the engine room is notreally as large as it looks on the plansbut it still is a pretty good access tothe engine and pretty good storage inhere behind this bulkhead is thelarge port side double cabin so there'sless access to the port side of theengine but most of the stuff you need toaccess on the engine is on the starboardside and you will be able to crawlaround and access the port side if youneed to there's also very good access tothe gearbox and all the hybridcomponentsand the prop shaft and so on as thatgoes into the stone assembly so this isthe double cabin on port side aftand of course it's mostly just a bigdouble bed and there's actually asignificant space here to move around itis close to the engine but the enginewill be really well insulated andhopefully won't be used too often in away of course at that end your end ofthis double bunk there'll be a bulkheadso the bunk will be enclosed on threesides and just open on this side butthere will be a port light into thefootwell of the cockpit there'll be somelight in there and there'll also besome port lights up herein the side of the companionway hatchi've tried to design this interior withas much flexibility in mind as possibleso i don't see any one of these cabinsor areas being a place where i wouldnecessarily live all the timeit could be nice to stay in here this iscertainly the most sort of comfortableprobably in private but then the pilotberth or the skipper's berth on theother side also has a lot of advantagesespecially when at sea it's close to allthe controls close to the engine reallyeasy to jump up the companionway hatchso while sailing that might be somewherewhere i would sleep but then also theforward cabin appeals to me a lot incertain situations uh because it wouldbe where the workbench is where a lot ofthe tools are and it will be a perfectplace for me you know and possibly apartner to live if we have guests inherewhich is a more sort of guestorientated cabin and i think there'sgoing to be enough space to accommodatea full racing crew but also enoughcabins and privacy for cruisingall right well i hope you guys enjoyedseeing my plan for the interior it isstill under development uh it couldchange as i get used to the mock-up andadd a couple more bits in there so i aminterested in hearing your ideas as wellso leave them down below in the commentsbut do be aware thatwhen arranging a layout like this it'snot as simple as just looking down atthe plan view and sort of drawing lineswhere you want the edges of the cabinsto be the three-dimensional nature ofthe hull of the boat means there's a lotof restrictions in space about where youcan put thingsboth in terms of headroom and also interms of systems because we planned alot of space for batteries for dieseltanks water tanks and all sorts of othersystems things which restrict the spaceof where we can put things so often bymoving a bunk uh even just a few inchesit may make that bunk unusable or makesome other part of the boat unusable butstill i am open to ideas and suggestionsso keep them coming in now thanks a lotfor watching and a massive massive thankyou to everyone who has donated orotherwise supported the tally ho projectit does make a huge difference and itmeans that we're able to keep on doingthis work and i'm able to keep on makingthese videos so i really reallyappreciate it and i'll see you next timecheers[Music][Music]you,0

05K5glVCwis,Trying TikTok Computer Hacks...,1898229,107379,2248,"- I pride myself on
high quality tech tips,but those take like 10, 15 minutes,you guys don't have time for that.Could they be distilled into
more like 10 or 15 seconds?To find out,we took some of the best TechToks,that is to say TikToks with tech tips,and we're gonna tell you
guys if they check out.Starting with this pile
of broken cable boxes.- [Alex] Yep.- This is gonna be interesting.Unlike our sponsor CableMod,
they're just cables,but they look fantastic.CableMod allows you to
personalize the look of your PCwith custom colored cables.Try out their configuratorand get a realistic preview of your cablesat the link down below.(upbeat music)One of the most fun
things for me about thisis I haven't actually seen
any of these TechToks,and our first one is from Dylan.- @dylan_844.- Got it, there's a lot of Dylan's.- [Alex] I had to go to the
thrift store and pick upthese old DirectTV DVRs.- This TikTok suggests
that a great way to geta cheap hard drive is to go to
the thrift store and buy oneof these old DVRs for as
little as five, or we paid $10,then strip it down to
extract the Numi hard drive.Dylan suggests that you can
find drives that are as largeas one or even two terabytes
inside these units,which would be one heck of a value.And we can actually already
see in this one that Dylanmight be onto something.One thing Dylan glossed overin his very concise guide though is thatthose are security screws.(saw revving)- Okay just hold on there for a second.That's not very safe.You can hold that a bit better.- [Linus] Oh yeah, not bad.(saw cutting)- Oh yeah.- [Alex] You want some gloves?I'm gonna get you some gloves.- [Linus] Nah, I'm fine.(saw cutting)I am very covered in metal shards.- [Alex] Can I suggest-- [Linus] Nah, I'm good.(Saw cutting)(metal clanking)Now it's time to find out what I gotfor my $30 starting with the gray one.That definitely has a hard drive inside.Wow, that is a dusty disgusting machine.And sure enough, SATA hard-drive,got some hot glue on the
connectors to make surethat they don't come out.I've seen that trick before.And oh, that's a disappointment.I don't even know what a DB 35.2 is,but I know 160 gigabytes when I see it.That's not worth the $5 Dylan promised,let alone the 10 that I paid.This is like those videos where youjust open up Pokemon card
packs or Kinder Surprisesexcept dirtier and way grosser.(metal clanking)There we go.Hey, 500 Gigs this time.I mean, I actually don't
know that I would pay $10for a 500 Gig drive,but that's a lot better than
paying $10 for 160 Gig drive.Am I right?(metal clanking)Now for door number three500 Gigs.What is a Pipeline hard drive?Man, these OEM only models
that I've never heard of.Very, very strange.Still, this is at least worth extracting.So we've gonna go aheadand take out two standard
Phillips head screwsright here and here.Then do a little bit of
negotiating because the other sideis actually held down by
these little bent metal tabs.And a one. (metal clanking)- [Alex] That's probably
great for the hard drive.- Oh no, that's probably fine.Honestly, actually, the way
they validate these things,it's like crazy.A few more screws to remove
the hard drive from it's sled.Then we pop this guy off a voila,completely standard 500 Gig drive.All in all we salvaged 1.16
terabytes of hard drivesfor about 23 US dollars,
not the worst deal on Earth,but Dylan failed to mention a few things.The tools required to
actually extract the drives.The precautions that should
be taken when workingwith equipment that has
exposed power supply circuitry,like these DVRs.The incredibly important step
of checking the model numberof the units so that you can find outhow much hard drive space
it has before you buy it.And of course,the minor detail that
these hard drives have beenin use for oftentimes a very long timeunder non-ideal conditions.And the odds of them actually
working are less than 100%.In fact,only two of them spun up and
were detected by our system.And only one of them,a 500 Gig model managed to
pass a short drive self test.So overall a lot more creativethan shucking external drives,but these omissions are gonna
cost Dylan_844 a few points.I give this TechTok a 7/10.But if (metal falling)
adding sketchy hard drivesto your system isn't the best idea.What can you do if your drive is full?Well, one idea is to just free up spaceon your existing machine.We watched countless TikToks and this oneby @hardwaresavvy is definitely the best,but also the most infuriating,because he almost got it right.- [@hardwaresavvy] How to
instantly free up gigabytesof space from your PC.And you'll be surprised
to find a lot of appsthat are taking up a lot of
space that you haven't usedin a long time like this one here.- This is all fine.- [@hardwaresavvy] In the next video,I'm gonna show you a tool
that's gonna allow youto free up tens of gigabytes of datathat you never thought
existed on your hard.- He shows WinDirStat briefly,No video about it ever comes out.(Alex laughing)- Okay, uninstalling unused programsand cleaning up temporary
files are both a good start.But the truth is that four
Gigs isn't even enoughto install many game patches these days,let alone the entire game.And that's where the type of
tool that tech savvy showed us,but then didn't demonstrate
how to use is much more useful.We're gonna go to Ninite.com,
select WinDirStat,get your Ninite,and we're gonna install one of those toolsand show you guys how to use it.Now that WinDirStat is
installed all we need to dois wait for the analysis to run.You have 18 and a half gigs
in your recycle bin, Alex.When the analysis is done,you get this great
visualization that showsyour entire drive as a
mosaic of little squaresand rectangles.Then if you select a particular folder,you can actually see
an outline of every oneof the individual files
inside that folder.And that's what's really
great about a tool like thisis instead of only
targeting temporary filesthat the operating system itself createdand knows are temporary,it can target files that
you created temporarilyand then totally forgot about.Overall, we were able to
free up almost 30 gigabytesof unneeded data,so I give this TechTok
a 10/10 for the idea.The implementation where
he doesn't actuallymake the video he promised,drags it down to about a three.(upbeat music)We have no idea why these
videos are so big on TikToK.This is not hacking.It's the easiest cheapest content ever,but for whatever reason, it
racks up millions of likes.So they're fine.We tried it.But that wasn't really
the point of this segment.The point of this segment
is to try out someof the top TikTok hacks
that are about as hackingas what I just did was.(keyboard clicking)Our first hack from
@dreaaaaas has three quartersof a million likes and
almost a 100,000 shares.- [@dreaaaaas] You go up to this top barand you type in prnt.sc/ any two letterand any four numbers,and you press enter,and it will give you a screen
shot from somebody's phone.- Okay, so we're just going
to an image uploading service,typing in random characters, and hopingto creep someone's picture.- [Alex] Yeah, so I did
this for about 20 minutes.There were a couple that we can't show,but those were just stuff
like full GPA breakdowns,English proficiency tests,and someone's onboarding
for a job in Indiaas a mechanical engineer where
they were making $3 an hour,also lots of invoices,
and some Bitcoin wallets,all of which are not things
you should be putting on here.- Okay, so what's happening hereis people are using more
advanced screen capture softwarethan what's included with their computer.Snipping tool,which comes with Windows will
allow you to drag a windowand then save that file,but it only saves it locally.Some of these other programs
like ShareX, for example,have features that allow
you to automaticallyupload the image to an
image sharing service,and then they will actually take that URL,automatically copy it to your clipboard,and then allow you to
paste it and share itwith someone else.It's very convenient when
the images you're capturingaren't confidential or private,but this goes to show
you how easily peoplecould stumble across
them, whether by accident,or in this case on purpose.- [Alex] Oh, do you want
the best one that I found?- Not porn is it?I'd be enjoying a glass of wine,sitting back in a black leather armchairwatching a fireplace while
the walls in the room I am inare covered in screaming
and wailing faces.Yeah, definitely a way to kill an hourif you have nothing else to do,and unlike any of other hacks,you aren't actually accessing
compromised informationsomeone didn't intend to share with you.I'm giving it a 10.Time for our next hack.Everyone knows about inspect element, yep.It allows you to edit the
contents of a webpage.But if you go to console and
write document.designMode=""on"",you can edit just about
anything on the pageby typing normally.It's still not a hack,but if you're into doctoring screenshotsand causing mayhem within
your social circle,I could see this one coming in handy.I give this one a nine.It's just so convenient.I can share this with Steve right now.Steve just got back to me,""WTF. What the (beeping) is this lol?Joke or no?""I am literally the worst friend.I dropped everything and
immediately changed the passwordin the checking account.Can I upgrade that one to a 10/10 time?- [Alex] Yep.- Time for our next hack?- [Alex] This one's my favorite.- Oh God, okay.I see where this is going.Time to hide this homework folder.Customize, change icon,
pick an icon no onecould ever look for, yep.Hidden forever.Hiding in plain sight.It's not hacking, but I give it an 8.5/10.- [Alex] Really?- Well the thing about
hiding a folder is thatif whoever's looking for it knows howto show hidden folders,they will be able to find that one.So you can see it's as simple as changingmy file explorer settings to
show hidden folders and boom.Now MSN Network shows up
and you can see it's kindof grayed out.That's what hidden folders look like.So me, an intellectual,I'm gonna go,""Someone was trying to hide this.""Oh my (beeping).A better way to hide
it is to just leave itin plain sight then and encrypt it.So now our original MSN
network boom is emptyand this new folder can
only be accessed by me.Now that's a money shot.How to view any private Instagram post.- [@trueyt] So what
you're first going to dois you're gonna right click, hit inspect.- Oh good, we're back to inspect element.- [@trueyt] Click that
you're gonna hit remove.So after you y'all remove
the page hide button,all you gotta do is
hit the refresh button.Ooh, there y'all go, man.- That is pathetic if that actually works.You reload the page.Maybe at some point it was this easy.Apparently it doesn't work anymore.I'm giving this a 1/10.Why does it have 23,000 likes?- One really popular type of TechTokis people showing off
their epic gaming rigsand talking about just how
affordably they can be obtained.- [@1dktech] This is my gaming setup.- Oh god, her voice is so annoying.- First off with the PC,when I bought it, it was around $1,100.However, I made a few upgrades so far.So I think that price
goes up to around 1,300.- You think?You think?- [@1dktech] I think the entire
keyboard was around $350.- You think?- [@1dktech] The mic was free
'cause it got sent out to me.I paid for my Boom Arm,so the total for my gaming
set up was around $2,560.- By that logic.- Well, you guys wouldn't
believe how affordableyou can get this set up.I paid $0.EK sent this over to us so
that we could put it in videosand have like a sick gaming
rig and wow these two plantswe got from Ikea for a total of,I think it was $10.I got these lightsabers.Maybe these were 20 bucks
each at the Disney Store.Who's counting anyway?These gold coins, these
were set by dbrand,(beeping) you dbrand.Obviously the best part
though is this LTT Store,Northern Lights Desk Pad,
only 29.99 at lttstore.com.Samsung sent us this monitor.They actually sponsored
the video we made about it.So net this cost negative dollars.So in total,this gaming setup cost you less than $0.Enjoy, hope it was helpful.Fricking idiot.(Alex laughing)- [Linus] Watch what
happens when I turn onmy epic gaming battle station.(rock music playing)Okay, rigging VLC to open
a video file when you turnon your computer, not exactly a hack,but I can see why the
kids would be into this.Unfortunately, what they didn't show you,is how to do it.Step one is you'll need someoneto control your RGB lighting.Andy, do you want to come
out from behind the table?(Andy vocalizing)- Yeah, we had an iPad to do that,but the app was being complicated,so Andy pressed the button.Anyway, the point is,all you gotta do is go on spiceworks.comand there's this great topiccalled Windows 10 Play a video upon loginbefore loading the desktop.It's a bit of doing.It will take awhile but (film reeling),the point is if you really wanna do that,you can follow this guide,or maybe there's a better one.I don't know.I don't care, it doesn't matter.I give this one a 4/10.It's definitely cool,but they don't show you
how to do it at all.What else we got here?Oh, good, @hardwaresavvy is back.- [@hardwaresavvy] Here's how to makeyour computer faster in 10 seconds.- Ooh.- [@hardwaresavvy] Restart your computer.When you enter your bios,find your bios, find
your RAMs X.M.P. profile,click on it, and choose it.- Oh man, okay.There's a few things here.One, yes X.M.P. can be a way
to get a little bit more speedout of your computer,but in many cases, the X.M.P. rated speedof your RAM will not actually run stablywith your motherboard and the
integrated memory controlleron your CPU.- I give this tech tip a 6.5.It's a valid tech tip,but there's a lot of details missing.Yeah @hardwaresavvy could have mentionedthat it's called D.O.C.P.on AMD systems.That's, that's useful.That's good to know.(rock music)- Oh my God.Shut up.Okay, so it shows you how
to add multiple thingsto the windows clipboard.All right, that's pretty handy.Let's try it.Ctrl+C, Ctrl+C.Just make sure that you
don't enable this featureon a shared computer
if for whatever reasonyou are copying things that you wouldn'twant anyone else to see.(Linus vocalizing)Good TechTok, 9.5/10.I like it.Our final TechTok from @dasavage1013,has 59,000 hearts and 2,000 shares.- [@dasavage1013] Push the FN Windowsand Shift key with B.It's gonna reset slash fix your driversand your graphics card.Okay, Ctrl+ Windows+Shift+B.Okay, 9/10.Could be a useful TechTok.Just like this could be a useful messagefrom our sponsor, FreshBooks.FreshBooks is the easy to

people play fortnite gotyour pals in there in fortnitedo i have pals and fortnite of course idodo you think it's time toi don't know try a new gamemaybe a game on a pc instead of this20-inch imac over hereuh you know i don't really play too manygames this is just more casualcasualdo you think there's anythingcasual about working at unbox therapydo you know the type of gaming equipmentwe have herekeyboardsgaming micegaming pcs with rgb and monitors thatare bigger than 20 inches i just playfor casual you knowlet me configure a setup for youthat just fits in a little bit betterheregiven the type of equipment we haveaccess to rtx you ever heard of rtxyeah i've heard of it you ever heard of240 hertz no this is fine i meanthe keyboard it's anot a lot of key travel therenobutit's fine the mouse it doesn't havededicated left and right button yourhand is in pain right nowwell it's light yeah your your aim isterrible right now no this is fine imeanwhat's thisthis what is thisuhthat's that's mine don't we don't talkabout that[Music][Music]this is the samsung odyssey mio g9 thisis a 49-inch gaming monitor ultra widequantum matrix technology quantum miniled how many quantums you got i got none1000 r curved screen do you understandimmersion sir[Music]not yetsirthis is the odyssey neo ultra wideobviously and a tremendously aggressivecurve this is going to be perfect forwilly dude's gaming experience[Music]look at the immersion as you sit sort ofin this cockpit over 5000 pixels acrossup to 240 hertz these are thepossibilities with windows based gaming[Music]of course we have our mechanicalkeyboard of choice and a gaming mouse togo with it[Music]it's almost as nice to look at from theback as it is from the front[Music]they've gone with this stormtrooper lookblack and white contrastobviously you can also see the rgb thatthey've worked in and it's not just likea simple strip but if you look at itclosely it almost seems to go oninfinitely in there it looks like a voidon the inside it's a nice implementationyou probably also noticed a headsethanging on the back there's this littlegaming headset or headphone hanger andit locks up out of the way when it's notin use and you simply pull down on itand it flicks out and thenyou can stick your headset right thereconveniently keep things tidysomething that a lot of large monitorsdon't have is adjustability this onevery smoothly movesfroma low position to a high position it canalsosurprisingly pivotreasonably well and it has some tiltalsoso big monitorbut some flexibility on therethey've thought about cable managementyou may have a number of inputs goinginto the monitor so the monitor doeshave a hub so your peripherals can plugdirectly into it the way that this cablemanagement works is through this backchannel this piece pops off and againit's really smooth to do and then you'reable to run your various cablesthrough this section which of courseincludes your keyboard mouse whateveryou want to plug directly into themonitor as far as inputs and outputs areconcerned we have two usb a ports overhere of course we also have the usbcable going back to the pc in order tooperate the hub here is an 8k capabledisplay port cable plugged into thedisplay portand this was included in the package asi mentioned you have one two more hdmisand then you've also got an analog audioport for your wired headset if you useoneover on this other side here we have ourconnection for power and there's noexternal power brick so everything isbuilt in so all you'll have coming outof the monitor is simply a typical powercableand then you've also got this plate hereand this just clips onto the back tocover up your cable management onceyou've got everything installed now ofcourse with this new model you also havethe advantages of mini led now we're allaware of the pros and cons with mini ledfor myself personally i think thetrade-offs are worth it i've seen it intv tech i've seen it on tablets nowseeing it in ultra wide format i thinkmost people are going to be able toappreciate some of those advantages withmini led now i think we can probablyagree that if you're into gaming ifgaming is a part of your life then thisparticular implementation is farsuperior to the one that will do wastrying to pull off earlier in this videowe have 49 inches of gaming pleasure asopposed to his what was he using 21.5 orsomething like that we have rtx graphicswe have a mechanic keyboard we have agaming mouse uhi think he's going to be pleasantlysurprised[Music]i mean 49 inches you got to admit it'smaking some kind of difference for youyou know what i can get used to thisthis has got to be a better place togame i mean the immersion the comfortlevel 240 hertz i think i'm getting alot more killsyou've got flexibility with the ultrawide you can split the screens do thegame streaming get the obs the gaming onone sideand now that you're on the pc sideyou have the latest titles way moreselectionall the

tyt3MUAWGfM,Speedrunning Cuphead is much harder than you think,675641,31018,420,cuphead is a really good game when itcame out in 2017 it was instantly lovedby a lot of people including me theentire game is hand-drawn to look likean old cartoon and everything looksamazing the story is pretty simple butinteresting too cuphead and his brothermugman were gambling at a casino andlost their souls to the devil after thatsince they wanted to keep their soulsthe devil told them that they couldrepay their debt by taking the souls ofother people who owe him and that'swhere we start now for the gameplay it'spretty addicting it's full of 19different boss battles all of theirdifferent gimmicks and strategies all ofthem are incredibly difficult and thegame is hard to even beat casually I didbeat it though and I wanted more so herewe are today here's my cuphead speedrunbut before we get into the actual videoI just wanted to point out that around70 of the people who watch my channelaren't subscribed if you end up enjoyingthe video and want to see more speedruncontent feel free to because it helpsout the channel a lot but anyway here wego cuphead starts out with a cutscenethat we Skip and goes straight to someold dude named outer Kettle because ofour predicament outer Kettle gives uspowers to take out all the debtors so weget that leave his house and make it tothe Overworld then we get some moneyfrom a random person sitting on thebridge and go right into the only runand Gun level we'll be doing throughoutcuphead there are several optionalrunning gun levels you can do these arelevels where you just try to make it tothe end rather than beat a boss and theygive you coins which you can use to buyupgrades we want to do this level to getfive more coins and have a total ofeight the level also isn't too difficultthe main strategy is just always beshooting and dashing forward to go asfast as possible then it's just a matterof collecting coins and dodging enemiesbefore we finally make it to the endthis leads us into the shop where we canbuy our two main weapons of the speedrunthe lobber and spreadshots but I'llexplain why these are useful as we usethem for now we equip them in thecuphead and move on to our first bossfight the root pack this is a prettysimple boss fight where we have to dealwith three different vegetables first wehave the squash where we get reallyclose to him and shoot directly in hisface with the spreadshot the idea behindthe spreadshot is it does a lot ofdamage why has low range so this isnecessary it's not too difficult as theboss has a really simple attack patternthat you can just memorize and all wehave to do is jump over his shots asthey come next is the onion boss andwhile we wait for him to spawn we set upa lobber trap the lobber bouncesmultiple times before it disappears soit can shoot multiple attacks in the airand they'll all hit the onion as hespawns then we do two of our ultimateattacks or exes at the ground next tohim you can see how many exes you havebased on the amount of cards on thebottom left of the screen and you fillup these cards by shooting enemies orpairing pink attacks like we did in theRun and Gun stage these are obviouslyjust more powerful attacks that will beused a lot now if we shoot a lobber exon the ground it actually hits the bosstwice and does double its normal damageand this will be useful multiple timesin the run after we're done with theonion we just have the karabas where wewant to shoot him with our spreadshotand ex with the lobber until he dies wecan also intentionally take damage so wedon't need to dodge his attacks andfinish him off pretty easily there we goone out of 19 done the next boss battlewe need to face is against Ruby andcroaks these are two frogs that worktogether to take us out and they sharethe same Health points the initialstrategy is to get close with thespreadshot and shoot them with as muchdamage as possible they have twodifferent attacks they can do butthey're easy to dodge so it isn't toobad once you get them low enough onhealth though their next phase is alsonot too bad one tries to blow you backwith a fan while the other shoots ballsat you but all we need to do is payattention and go through we'll also wantto use our exes whenever we can butthat's going to be true for most bossesso for the future I'll gloss over thatunless there's a specific strategy withthem finally they get into their lastphase which is a slot machine here theycan use three different attacks luckilyfor this run though we got the bestattack two times in a row The CoinAttack is super easy to dodge andperform exes while you do it so the restof this boss was really easy and thatleads us to the third fight of the runand it's against goopy Legrand he's agiant slime monster that jumps around todamage you we pretty much just followhim around with our spreadshot until weswitches phases he also sometimes uses aface attack but we can duck under thatand keep shooting him then his secondphase is the exact same strategy buthe's bigger it just makes him easier tohit though finally we get to his lastphase where he turned into a gravestonein this phase we just want to hit theface of the gravestone as much aspossible since we also conserved ourhealth we can just take damage and keephitting him to beat the boss faster butthat's about it he's dead after just abit more effort next we do a quickairplane tutorial that we skip out of togo to hildeberg see while most of theboss battles have you play as regularcuphead some of them give you airplanefights in my opinion these are generallyeasier but I can bet none the person forhildo we just need to follow hermovements and constantly shoot hershe'll turn into different animals andtry to hit us with her laughs but it'snot too hard to dodge we can also use asuper ex once we get five cards whichdoes some good area damage after thatit's more or less the same stufffollowing her movements and getting herto freak out and turn into a moon forsome reason in this phase she'll stickher face out at us which is a perfecttime to use regular exes because they'llhit her multiple times other than thatit's just some simple dodging and wemake quick work of her this is when weget to the fifth boss Cagney CarnationI'm just gonna call him the flowerthough originally when I was firstspeedrunning this game the flower is mybiggest reset Point his moves were justweird the good thing is since I reset somany times I got good enough to beat himconsistently who would have guessedpractice actually pays off so I learnedif he uses his down attack shoot up ifhe uses a slipper jump and if he usesseeds jump in ex the first phase is justreacting to his moves and the secondphase is pretty much the same he doestake up more of the map and the secondphase though so we need to always be onthe platforms but after playing this guyenough times he becomes really easy toread is just use the lobber jump use anex and slowly take out his health so heyanother one off the list and now we'removing into the next area after a shorttalk with King dice here's where we getinto another fight which used to be ahuge reset point for me baroness VonBonbon Bonbon is annoying because shehas multiple different mini bosses thatyou need to defeat before attacking heralso there's more stage hazards witheach boss we got a good start with thegumball boss who you just need to leadin a circle and spreadshot but I was badand got hit that kind of hurt next phasewe got the chocolate guy who fliesaround and shoots his body all acrossthe stage this is really difficult todeal with but after playing this fightway too many times I had a good read onhow to finish him off finally we got themuffin this dude jumps around the mapand causes damage around him we stayaway from him and be a little patientand he's not too bad this puts us in theFinal Phase of Bonbon but while she'sgetting that ready we can do multiplespreadshot exes directly on her makingevery shot hitter doing massive damageif I saved all my hearts I cut a damageboosted and finished her off with thisstrategy but I'm bad so I had to backoff and beat her with the regular shotoh yeah this is the reason why weswitched back to that for the bonbonfight by the way but anyway like anyother boss she falls and we can move onnow before we get to the next boss wewant to talk to this random guy whoupgrades our airplane with anotherattack which you'll see when we use itin the next fight against Wally warblesWally is another pretty simple air fightwe follow his moves in Dodge's attackswe also want to Parry one of the pinkbirds to fill up our meters and use asuper once he gets to this stage so wecan finish it quickly the next phase hebecomes a baby bird and we want to getas close to the little guy as possiblehe periodically tries to shoot us butthat can be parried and the dude doesn'ttake too long to finish finally the lastphase of Wally is him on a literalstretcher but that doesn't stop us wewant to use our new attack to hit himfrom above and use ex moves on the sideof him to hit him multiple times alsowhen Wally dies the birds carrying himtake out salt and pepper so that'sinteresting anyway hey look we haveanother flying fight right away theJimmy the great I probably pronounce hisname wrong so I'm just gonna call himthe genie in the Genie's first phasehe'll try to attack us with someprojectiles well want to Parry as manyas possible and hit him with all theexes we have after that is an autoscroller part where we need to dodge theblades and shoot his faces to advancethen it's a bit of fighting in hiscoffin phase but since we damaged him somuch earlier this doesn't take too longthe genie kinda gets desperate here sohe copies us and uses a replica toattack us yeah it's a one-to-oneimitation here we want to hit him with afew exes before charging up our superwhile dodging attacks before using it tofinish off this face then we finally getinto his last phase yeah I know he has alot where he becomes really big thiskind of just means he's easy to hitthough periodically dodging attacks fromhis eyes and the floating pyramids whileusing some exes to whittle down hishealth finally we can move on this dudetakes forever and it's time for an evenweirder fight bappy the clown bappy isaggravating because there are so manydumb things that can hate you he startsout hanging out in a bumper car whilesome ducks fly above the stage I reallyfocus on hitting the Ducks because we'llhave to jump over beppy multiple timesand I don't want to take unneeded damageafter a bit he'll go into his next phasehis head becomes a big balloon and heuses balloon animals to attack you whilethe roller coaster comes by periodicallythis part isn't too scary but we want tokill him as fast as possible this isbecause we want to beat his next phasebefore the roller coaster comes byunfortunately I got bad RNG Andy spawnedon the wrong side of the stage but wecatch up to him and shoot him from belowhere's where it got a bit scary thoughthe roller coaster came by and I got hitleaving me with only a single heartthankfully I finished this phase withouttaking any more damage and there wasonly one more phase left we can set up alobber trap and hit his Final Phase withmultiple spreadshot exes then we need tostay above the roller coaster for a bitcontinue to hit him and finally finishedhim off with one last ex this wasactually terrifying though because I wasincredibly close to getting hit by abaseball but hey doesn't matter we madeit through now it's time to get on tothe hard part of the game our next fightis the dragon Grim Matchstick the dragonstarts out with hitting us with somei-beams but we can Parry some of themthen he has this annoying attack wherehe'll try to use fireballs and his tailat the same time I usually try to stayfar back because this part is reallyeasy to get hidden the next phase iseasy though the dragon starts shootingout fire people which periodically tryto jump and hit us that's all we need tofocus on though so you just have towatch them and see if any are startingthe jumping animation finally after abit more damage the dragon Sprouts threeheads and I hate this phase the headswill shoot Fireballs but if we hit themwith our shots they burst and are evenharder to dodge the strategy for this isonly shoot when I'm jumping far abovethe dragon heads to make sure thisdoesn't happen he also has a fire breathattack but we just need to stay abovehim and it's perfect time to shoot someexes the the Final Phase is terrifyingfor me because I have lost way too manyruns to it but I finally finished it offby being patient and sticking to theplan now hey look we can go on to thethird island King dice tries to talk tous one more time but no one really careswhat he has to say and we go intoanother major reset point for me rumorhoney bottoms the B area starts out witha police officer charging at us andthrowing out some weird exploding orbthing we have to dodge the random workerbees too who look way too sad I try tostay far away from everything because wereally don't want to get hit here thenwe have a couple more phases where wefight the queen bee she starts out witha ball attack which follows us but it'spretty slow and easy to dodge then sheuses a triangle attack which also isn'ttoo bad but you'll notice something Istopped shooting at her I use my cardsto see how much damage I've done in thisfight and once it reaches around thispoint I stop this is because we don'twant to get her into her next phase yetsince we can do more damage for thatphase during this one after she getsinto her next attack pattern we're freeto attack again and get more and moredamage the face is easy to dodge and itgives us a ton of time to attack then ina little bit she comes back down andturns into a plane but because we did somuch damage earlier this phase is reallyquick to beat and that's good becauseit's usually not a fun one next we haveto fight Dr calls robot the robot fightstarts with us needing to attack threedifferent points its head chest andbelly once all three spots are destroyedits heart comes out and we can shootthat for a while until it breaks here'swhere we have a really cool Strat wherewe can skip the next phase by shootingthe robot's flying head and using asuper doing just enough damage down theface then unfortunately we get into therobot's Final Phase here the scientistuses a bunch of projectiles and we needto dodge all of them the phase isannoying because this goes on for a verylong time and it's just constantlypaying attention which can get reallystressful finally though we beat it withjust one hit point left so that was alittle too close for comfort okay timefor some easier bosses at least let's goto Sally stage play Sally is a woman whois about to give married but decides tofight us for some reason probablybecause I'm trying to tag her soul herfirst phase is pretty easy where we justshoot her with her spreadshot and sheloses all her health she has slow movingattacks so this isn't a problem at allin the next phase it's pretty much thesame thing but she also has robots toattack us and a baby that throws bottlesat us the whole time I hate this kid andthird phase is When Sally turns into I'mnot actually sure what this is supposedto be and uses meteors large waves andlightning to damage us but she's closeto the ground so it's a good time to getsome close quarter spread shots wefinally get to her last phase where sheflies around the top of the screen OneUmbrella chases after us and Roses fallinto the stage here I just want to jumpup and spreadshatter eventually gettingrid of the final bits of her health soyeah not too bad and the next fight isalso pretty easy because we just need tobeat the rat we're in a Roman the ratstarts out with some relatively easy tododge attacks and we just use ourregular shot on him and yeah like I saidthe attacks are easy to dodge but Isomehow got hit twice so that was fun atleast in the next phase we just need toswitch between the top and bottomplatform while shooting him with herspreadshot a lot of stuff comes afteryou but it's all slow and relativelystress-free finally we get to the cafeswhere we take out his health with abunch of spreadshot exes and it's notbad at all the cat has very slow attacksand it's just a matter of not being badyeah I'm also surprised that I succeededat that anyways our next boss is Captainberniebeard this fight can be kind ofannoying but also isn't too bad wemostly want to stay close to the captainand hit him with spread shots then whenhe tries to attack we can back up anduse our regular shot always beingmindful of the barrel that tries to fallon us as the fight goes on the captainwill send out more animals and the boatwill try to spit at us but I maintain mydistance and slowly decrease this healththis is when the bow gets sick ofBrittany beard and kicks him off forthis phase I like staying back andtaking my time to dodge the Fireballsthen when the boat uses a charge attackwe can duck under it while getting somespreadshot damage in after a bit of thisthe boat finally gets beat and we moveon to calamaria Maria is a mermaid Ithink but she uses multiple seacreatures to attack us she can alsocombine attacks making them hard tododge as you can see with me takingdamage this is when I died yeah so alittle backstory for this run more thananything I wanted to get a deathlessspeedrun so for about three days that'sall I did this resulted in around 20hours of just constant failure but thiswas the farthest I've ever gotten so Iwas like whatever I'm just gonna keepgoing yeah I'm really happy I did thatfor my sanity anyways in our secondattempt against Maria we dodged ourattacks in a much better way and gotonto her Medusa phase here she canfreeze you and you need to mash out ofit she also gets eels to attack us aswell but they have pretty easilydodgeable attacks so it wasn't too badfinally we got onto this phase and nowshe's just ahead it's pretty much thesame idea now Dodger attacks and mashout of the freezing until she's dead wealso didn't even take any damage here sowhy couldn't I have done this first trywhatever let's move on to our finalthree bosses of the game the 17th fightof the game is the Phantom Express andyeah I got hit right away so I quicklyreset because I really didn't wantanother death anyways usually this firstphase isn't too hard we just shoot hiseyes and Dodge the pink things that theflying pumpkins drop not too bad thesecond phase ramps up the difficultythough because we need to move the carback and forth by parrying the sides wealways want to be right under his headso we can use spreadshots and not gethit by the hands the things that thepumpkins drop can also move the car andmess everything up so we need to be waryof that the third face has two differentheads sprouting up from both sides ofthe train we can use spreadshot exes todo a lot of damage but their attacks canget a bit annoying eventually thoughthey crumble and we're on to the lastphase here's where the train becomes arunning furnace we need to open it up byhitting the pink tail and then shootingits heart when we do this it shoots abunch of fireballs at us so we need toconstantly Dodge those honestly not toobad so finally we got it done and therewere only two more fights now before weget to the devil it's time to fight Kingdice King dice has an interestingmechanic where you hit a three-sidedDice and will fight whichever boss youland on throughout this track there arealso extra hearts on the board if youhit him so I actually decided to resetthe fight once to get better placementso the hearts match the fights I wantedto do the first fight we hit a three andfight this boss we had a cool strategywhere once he comes to our side wedamage Booth through him and he shootsat literally nothing then we get a tonof free damage and he's really easy tofinish next we want to get a one on thedice to get a safe spot and then anotherthree this puts us at the skeleton horsehere we just need to dodge his presentattack and the jumping Horseman at thebottom we only need to be aware of theblue ones though since they're the onlyones that jump so it's not too bad eventhough I lost two hearts anyways we getanother three on the dice and fightliterally the easiest boss in the gamethe pool ball just kind of sits theresometimes sending out a beam of lightand we just need to use the axes on himand Dodge's very very easy attacks nowfinally after those three mini bosses wecan roll a 2 for another safe spot andanother two to fight King dice in thisphase we need to Parry the paint cardshe sends out while shooting him with herspreadshot this isn't too bad once youget used to it and it's easy to get somesteady damage out we can also EX inbetween the card waves to get some extradamage and eventually King dice Fallsit's time for the final boss the devilthe Devil is a hard boss he has a lot ofdifferent annoying attacks he can usebut as long as we're careful it's nottoo bad too bad I wasn't careful but wejust want to dodge the different attacksthat come out and play smart you don'tneed to rush this fight just react keeptrack of his minions and stay calm thatdidn't stop me from getting hit a secondtime in the first phase though yeah Iwas stressed but the next phase isn'ttoo bad his hurt boxes are on his eyesand they're pretty big targets otherthan that we Dodge as ax attacks to comethrough and Perry whenever he uses weirdear bomb attack not too bad once he getsinto his angry phase we have some morethings to worry about and oh wait I justdied yeah but I'm so far in the run thatI might as well finish it so as I wassaying once we get into the angry phasewe have to worry about the purplemonsters on the side of the devil buttheir attacks are pretty predictablethen we ex his eyes to get a ton ofdamage as we go through I did get hit afew times in this phase but that wasfine because I almost never die in theFinal Phase when he cries like a babyhere there's only one platform and areyou kidding me yep I died again fine onelast time we make it to this last phasewhen the poker chips fall down on aplatform we do this little movementwhere we jump around them it's awesomeand we finish out the devil and finallycomplete our speed run47-15 which looking on speedrun.com putsus at 148th place we are done hey I knowthere were some big mistakes at the endof the run I just can't do this againyeah cuphead speedrunning broke mave,0

like learn how toglide and stuff come on amber leavingalreadysee you next time thendon't make me wait too long thoughoh my god i totally get it i get theappeal now and it isn't even just kayakaya is but one of many characters youcould potentially fall in love withwhich i know isn't really the point ofthe game at all but listen to thesevoicesno need for small talk all that mattersis that you were safe last nighti can see how hard you've been workingtodaylet me think of a way to reward youwe should look for a place to takeshelteri'll be fine but we don't want youcatching a coldi used to think interaction with otherswas a waste of time but after meetingyou i'd rather spend my time on youththan other mattersnow you know what the best part aboutbeing a kia simp is he's free heautomatically gets added to your partyand i get to justuse him whenever i want and listen tohis voice lines and admire him in allhis beautybut you know who else i discovered ireally really like pymon yeah you heardme paimon see even before i startedplaying genshen i was seeing a lot oftalk on my timeline about how annoyingpymon was but i actually think she'sreally cute she asks dumb questions andshe's motivated by food and honestlysame so i don't want to see any paimonslander in the comments okay because ifeel very connected to this characterand if you're on piemon you'recrapping on me too okayshe's adorable and no i'm not won overby her because she's a tiny cute fairybut that's like 60 of the reason whyshe's so stinking cute look at her don'tyou just want to gobble her up iactually already went ahead and got thispie mom plushie look at how cute she isshe's so stinking cute with her littlethree mouth and her big old head andahi figured i'd end up down here one wayor anotherwhat the chili you're in this hole tooemily i'm in a lot of different holesoh god mind your phrasing chili pleasei'm sure a lot of people enjoy thereally grindy aspect of the game whereyou hack and slash your way to levelingup and becoming an unstoppable force theteam comprised of four of the hottestpeople alive and yeah that part isreally fun and feels fulfillingespecially when you're finally strongenough to battle the enemies that youkept nervously walking around before buti find that i really enjoy the leastcombat heavy story quests like the questwhere you have to assist zhangling in acooking contest or the one where lisatakes you all around monstat to findoverdue library books and you get theoption to pick different things based onwhether you think it'll please her ornot like a little date or when you haveto be zongley's sugar mama for an entireafternoon i just think it's fun when youget to interact with the characters forlonger than one conversation and you getto experience their unique personalitiesdoing little errands in monsta makes mekind of wish i were transported therenot as an adventurer but like one ofthose npcs at the restaurants that's howi usually feel whenever i play fantasybased games like this like wow i'd liketo live here i don't want to fightmonsters or anything i want to be thenpc that bakes bread and sells it to thepeople who do fight the monsters or anoble woman in pc who lounges around inthe castle and make small talk with theplayers the soundtrack is also reallyreally pretty i think my favorite rightnow is the music that plays at

3q3ECDEhqgE,How To Beat The DEATH GAME In Funhouse,1230859,60245,650,[Music]if you've been kidnapped to star in areality tv show only to find you've beentrapped in a brutal death game whatwould you do when popularity is the onlything keeping you alive the mostmanipulative person will be the winnerand you'll never guess who it is i'mgoing to break down the mistakes madewhat you should do and how to beat thedeath game in funhousemillions of people are going to watchthis man die casper here wakes up at astrange room with no idea where he isand the only clue is this welcome cardon the side of his bed walking out ofhis room the man finds two other guys inthe common area and they're just asconfused as he is they all agreed toappear on a reality tv show but neverread the contract and now they have noidea what they're in for the man in thepink shirt tells them they were allsedated before they were brought heretheir phones were taken away and all theexits are locked all the remainingcontestants walk into the common roomand say hello to the other players whensuddenly the tv turns on and announcesthat fergus's house of fun hasofficially started they're offering fivemillion dollars to the lucky winner andeach of the contestants are introducedto the audience that's when thisanimated panda fergus appears andexplains the rules every three days theaudience will vote on which contestantgets to stay and whoever has the leastvotes per round must complete achallenge if they fail they'll be takenout of the game but they have no ideathat losing will get them killed they'renot allowed to leave the house andeverything they do will be streamed 247. the only other people they'll see arethe staff but they're forbidden fromtelling the contestants anythingokay this is really suspicious first ofall every single one of thesecelebrities were drugged and kidnappedbut the fact that they seem laid backabout this tells us a lot about who theyare because it means that they're eitherall stupid or extremely desperate forfame and that kind of information willbe very important to our survival lateron now there's nothing here thatdirectly tells us this will turn into adeath game yet but they're soon going torealize that this reality show is ahorrifying trap to torture them forentertainment with challenges they'llhave to face if they want to be the solewinner of this game the viewers whowatch the show will be voting on whothey want to stay in the game but theywill be basing this decision on yourinfluence and friendliness within thegroup this makes the relationships weform with the other players incrediblyimportant to our survival because if wechoose to befriend the weakest player itwill hurt our chances the best strategyis to rank order each player's mostvaluable skills and influence level andmake sure that we are connecting to thestrongest players in the group if we aremore associated with the most talentedand likable players then we will beperceived in the same way and won't getvoted out in the early rounds now themost valuable player here in terms ofskills and intelligence has got to becat she's a chess master a trainedmartial artist and is smart enough tostay quiet and be observant while theothers run their mouths while thinkingin terms of influence the most valuableplayer is probably jimena she's a famousblogger known for covering celebritygossip so she has a natural ability tospend false narratives to damagesomeone's reputation this could be adeadly tool in a reality tv show becauseif we get on her bad side she couldmanipulate the voters against us we wantthat skill set working our favor so shewould be my next strategic relationshipthe weakest member has got to be dexierhe's a rapper whose fame is predicatedon musical talent if you want to call itthat so people will care much less abouthis opinion or personality that means hehas very little influence or skills thatwould be useful to arch survival theyoutuber in the pink shirt and oola theinstagram model are in the same categorythey don't have skills or transferableinfluence that can be utilized for gamesurvival so forming relationships withthem would be a waste of time this womanjimena thinks this game is verysuspicious but with a chance to win 5million dollars they all agree to theterms and decide to spend the next threedays partying as hard as they can thecontestants bond over the experiencegetting closer to each other andintroduce themselves to the viewers asthey try to get as many votes aspossible to advance to the next roundbut one of these players is about tobecome the game's first victim on thethird day the group gathers to watch asthe votes come in and find out that twocontestants have lost lonnie and evanshere will have to face each other in aknockout round to stay in the game theothers go to the small room to watch thelosers complete their challenge and apair of blinding goggles are placed overlonnie's eyes as music starts to playthat's when they all see nevin beinglowered down he's bound and gagged andthere's nothing they can do to warn herthat she's been tricked the woman isgiven a studded baseball bat and thenspun around by the staff before she'slet loose the other contestants watch inhorror as she swings the bat hitting himover and over until there's nothing leftbut a bloody pulp the announcer finallytells her to take off the goggles andshe's shocked to see the man's corpserealizing she's just committed murderthat's one down with seven to go thegroup is scared for their lives and theblonde woman begs to be let out but thepanda tells them they're trapped untilonly one contestant is left and if theydon't cooperate they will be punishedwith a fate worse than deathokay on the surface this is a terrifyingreality to find ourselves in but if youlook just beneath it you'll find a verystupid person with no instincts forsurvival this man did absolutely nothingto prevent himself from getting beatenwith a spiked baseball bat and if he'snot even gonna put up a struggle then hedeserves to die instead of hanging likea dead fish he could have lifted hislegs and swung on the chain to try andavoid getting hit if it were me i alsowould have tried kicking the bat beforeit strikes to get her attention becauseshe wouldn't be able to mistake me for apinata surviving this death gamerequired minimal effort and this manwasn't smart enough to even try now wecan also blame this girl but to a muchlesser degree she couldn't see anythingin the room and would have no reason tothink that it's a human being she washitting but there was still informationfor her to realize that something waswrong a paper mache pinata is extremelylight and you would be able to feel theweight and density of the object fromthe resistance in the bat's recoil itshould have been immediately cleared toher that she was not hitting this tinypinata and that's on her now this isjust about the only thing we can blameher for because psychologicalexperiments have clearly shown us thatwhen an authority figure tells you to dosomething you are statistically morelikely to obey them than to use your ownjudgment this is what they found in themilgram experiment where they had peopleparticipate by giving other peopleelectric shocks almost everyone obeyedthe orders against their own judgmentwhich is crazy and as long as theauthority seems legitimate people aremore likely to obey this is exactly whathappened and instead of paying attentionto her own intuition she killed a manand nobody could stop her but there'sone crucial detail here that they're allmissing this one was having the time ofher life while listening to music andyou can have the same experience withoutever having to get tangled up

to get 15 offyour raycon purchase thank you to rayconfor sponsoring this video the playersare freaking out when suddenly the pandaappears and congratulates them forreaching the next round they'rehorrified and begged to be set free fromthis reality show but that's when wefinally get to see the mastermind behindthis death game he's been the voice ofthe panda this whole time and tells themthat the only way to escape is to winnobody knows where they are and only oneof them will be let out of here alivethey go back to their common room to tryto figure out what they should do nextand this man dexier insists they shouldtry to escape looking around he finds awindow that leads outside and thinksthey might be able to climb over thewall casper insists they need to thinkof a better plan but the man refuses tolisten and throws one of the chairsstraight through the window breaking theglass suddenly the night sky glitchesout revealing itself to be a projectionand what they thought was outside isactually a closed off room they'resomewhere underground and they realizethere's no way out but to play and winthat's when the panda appears on thetelevision and tells them that since daxbroke the rules he will now be punishedthree masked men come into the roompointing their guns at the man and shoothim in the lake they drag him out andtake the contestant away to thechallenge room where they put him insidean empty vat all the players watch infear as the staff bring in a barrel fullof floral entamonic acid the panda tellsthem it's so corrosive that it can melta persons flesh in minutes and as thestaffed on the chemicals into the vatthe others can do nothing but watch ashe screams and agonizing pain after aminute of being submerged in the poolthe man is pulled out of the vat and theother contestants are horrified seeingthat he's half the man he used to bethat's two down with six to go in thecommon room the blonde woman isterrified that she's been tricked into adeath game but jimena here reminds hershe's not the only one who's been liedto she mocks the woman for using herbody to get votes knowing that theaudience just wants to see some skinit's a cheap tactic but the girl defendsherself saying that she needs to doanything she can to win and survive it'ssad but jimena here has zero compassionfor her and tries to go for the jugularthe woman tells everyone that oola issleeping with the irishman to manipulatehim to her advantage and it's justanother cheap tactic of using her bodyto get ahead in the game but casper herehas had enough furious he calls out thewoman's hypocrisy yelling that she'snothing more than a tabloid blogger whoexploits people for clicks lonnie herecan't believe they're arguing oversomething so stupid when people havejust died and they all realize that theonly way to survive is to play the gameokay this is getting gruesome but themost horrifying thing to realize here isthat there's nothing this guy could havedone to escape this is no ordinary deathgame because instead of traps they'repunishments so even if you escape theseguys will just shoot you down the onlyway to win is to play by the rules andprevent yourself from ever beingpunished in the first place with this inmind we need to be spending all our timestrategizing how to get more votes whiletargeting others to make them asunlikable to the viewers as possible nowas petty as these two girls might soundit demonstrates one of the moststrategic tools we have to work withbecause if you can bring out the worstqualities in another player withoutmaking yourself look bad then itmanipulates the vote and they'll be morelikely to die this is an absolutegoldmine of an opportunity here becauseall of these celebrities are selfishpeople who'll do anything for fame sothere are tons of bad qualities toexploit and we can turn the votersagainst them i would have done whatcasper did by targeting hemetic here andhighlighting just how evil she actuallyis by pointing out she's written storieson all the other contestants andexploited their suffering we can put thewhole group against her and if the grouphates her then the audience will hateher too i would also have defended ullahere when jimena was accusing her ofusing her sexuality to gain votes it's atotally fair criticism but sticking upfor her is going to make me look like agood guy and it will earn me more votesfrom the viewers pimetta will come outof the situation looking really bad andit's going to get her the least amountof votes which means she'll be next todie in the punishment round this is theideal situation to take advantage of andif we stir up as much chaos as possiblewithout getting emotionally involvedwe'll come out on top desperate to stayalive each player goes into theconfession booth and talks to theaudience and they'll say anything to geta vote with tears in her eyes hamettahere tells them she doesn't deserve tobe put through this death game while theblonde woman begs for help terrified ofdying the viewers feel sympathetic andstart voting on who should survive theydon't think this game is real butthey're about to find out they've made ahuge mistake as people around the worldhave been watching this death gamereality show the fbi have started aninvestigation to find the six kidnappedcontestants but the mastermind behindthis game has made sure there's no wayto block the show from streamingcasper's ex-wife appears on the air andpleads to the public to stop voting butthe reporter points out voting might bethe only thing that saves her ex-husbandthat night the group asks casper how hecame to meet his ex-wife and he explainsthat he started dating her before shebecame famous after three months oftouring together they got married andstarred in a reality tv show but thingstook a bad turn which eventually led totheir divorce suddenly the pandainterrupts the group's bonding sessionto announce the results of the next votethis time the blonde and the mexicanwoman are tied for last place they'reterrified of what punishment awaits andthe panda announces they must nowparticipate in a tie breaking challengecalled blind rage that's when the staffcome in carrying guns and take thelosers away to face their punishment inthe challenge room the panda explainsthe rules they will each be given an axeand when the lights go out they mustfight each other until one of them isdead with their weapons in hand thelights are turned off and the challengebegins jimena sneaks towards the othercontestant and starts swinging trying tokill the blonde the woman dodges herattack at the last second and drops theaxe on the ground leaving herselfdefenseless the odds are in jimena'sfavor but the blonde picks her weapon upand with one vicious swing she drivesthe axe straight into the other woman'sskull another contestant has just beenkilled and that's now three down withfive to gookay this is starting to get a lot moreinteresting because now we're seeingthese challenges turn into death matchesagainst the other players this is areally big deal and it actually gives usa much greater chance to stay in thegame instead of just being punished nowfrom the beginning of this challengeboth of these girls have the same oddsof winning but neither of them realizedthat whoever acts first is going to bemore likely to survive when the lightsgo out the first instinct is cautionbecause if we can't see then there's noway to defend ourselves against anoncoming attack this is exactly why weshould fight against this instinct andbe the first person to strikestrategically the most important thingto realize is that your opponent won'tmove right away so we'll be able to findtheir position from memory if we actquickly now this doesn't mean we shouldsprint straight at her because he mightrun right into her axe so if it were mei would use the room's geometry to myadvantage and move to the wall but he'deasily guide me to the opposite cornerthis puts you in an excellent positionto attack your opponent because nowyou're behind them and you'll be able touse the right angle corner tointuitively triangulate their lassoposition quite effectively the goal hereis to ram into them and push them overbecause you'll never be able to time theswing correctly if you don't know howclose you are to them once they are onthe ground you'll have a better idea oftheir proximity and be able to take themout in one fatal swing later that nightcasper's lying in bed when he hears aloud crash coming from the common roomrushing out he sees the irishman laidout drunk on the floor and sitting on acorner of the couch is the blonde oolashe asks him to take a seat next to herbut casper turns her down and realizingthat she's incredibly drunk the mancarries her back to her bed he's aboutto leave the room when she begs him tostay a bit longer and kisses himthinking that the audience will vote forthem if they sleep together that's whenthe irishman catches them in the act andgrabs casper here in a chokehold readyto strangle the man to death he's beensleeping with oola here since the firstnight in the game and even though heknows she's manipulating him the man isconsumed with jealousy suddenly lonnierushes in and gets in the let go butnobody realizes this one moment willchange the rest of the game the nextmorning the group gathers in the commonroom where the panda announces theresults of the next voting sessioncasper has been given the most voteswhile the blonde woman has received theleast but the panda will give her onefinal chance to survive she must play agame of memory and has two minutes tomatch pictures of her instagram selfiestogether before time runs out with theclock counting down she begins turningthe cards over and searches desperatelyfor its match but she's too slow thetimer reaches zero and she's failed tomatch the last two pairs so now she mustbe punished forced to spin the wheel offun to pick her form a punishment ullahere has no choice but to accept herfate the wheel lands on black andsentences her to execution by astretching rack one of the gunman grabsher but the woman freaks out and jumpsonto the man biting his throat openanother staff member rushes in to knockher out and the woman wakes up with fourropes tied to her arms and legs theother contestants watch as she slowlypulled apart and torn limb from limbuntil she dies that's four down withfour to go okay this was not a physicalchallenge but it was still extremelybeatable obviously if she had a bettermemory it would have helped but theremight have been a strategy here thatcould have saved her a lot of time tofigure out where the matches were thebiggest thing working against her hereis having to move across the room toflip the cards over because it's verytime consuming if it were me instead ofrunning around like a panicking chickenthe best method would be tosystematically reveal the row of cardsthat you are closest to and memorizethem then work your way one row afterthe other and you'll begin to findmatches by walking in a single directioninstead of wasting your time jumpingaround aimlessly now there is anotherway to optimize this and that would beto start from the center where you haveaccess to the most amount of cardswithout having to move around what'scrazy interesting here is that thisstrategy would actually give you a 97chance of finding a match within arm'sreach and a 70 chance of there beingmore than one pair now i know it soundsvery counter-intuitive and inprobability math this is called atheoretical paradox where a conclusionis true despite it seeming impossiblenow for oola here a 97 chance at findinga pair are great odds but despite thisit's still not the best strategy to usethe problem with this is that itrequires you to memorize more of themand the more cards you have to keep inyour short-term memory the easier it isto forget where they are on averagehumans can only store seven items intheir short-term memory and in astressful situation like this whereyou're playing for your survival eventhat is a lot to ask now none of thismeans it's not possible to win the gametwo minutes is an extremely short amountof time but as long as you have astrategy that keeps you from wastingyour time running around the room youmight have a shot at escaping this deathsentence and live to fight another dayinstead of creating a strategy tomaximize her two minutes ula herepanicked and it got her killed the nextmorning the group is depressed as theyrealize three more of them will die butthe panda decides to cheer them up andhas left a gift for them in the hallwaycasper opens the present and finds anenvelope for each player in the game butwhen they all look inside they findphotos of their families they startbreaking down in tears as they allrealize they may never see their lovedones ever again it's a harsh reminder tocasper of his parents tragic death as akid and he walks off to the pool room tocalm himself down lonnie here comes into check on him and comforts the man shetells him that this game is trying tomanipulate them and that he shouldn'tlet it get to his head later thecontestants gather back in the commonroom for the results of the next votingsession and find out that this time theirishman has gone the least amount ofvotes with casper far ahead in the leadas a reward for coming in first placethe panda shows what actually happenedbetween the blonde and casper the nightbefore it's clear to everyone thatcasper was a perfect gentleman andturned her offer down it's the reasonhe's getting the most votes out ofeverybody and the audience is showingtheir support the irishman realizes he'smade a terrible mistake and now it'sgoing to get him killed he apologizes tocasper for jumping to conclusions butthe audience has already made theirdecision the panda reveals that as theloser he'll have to enter a fight to thedeath against one of these four fightersall the voters watching make theirchoice and when they tally up all thevotes the audience has chosen botus herewho he'll have to fight to the death theplayers know that he doesn't stand muchof a chance fighting against this guyand the group toasts the man to wish himluck in the most irish way possible theirishman heads to the challenge room toface off against his opponent inside hefinally meets botus and this man is anabsolute giant it's an unfair fight butthe irishman takes his corner and a bellrings to start the fight the two mentrade blows and even though his opponentis significantly bigger the irishmanovercomes the odds and chokes him todeath he's the only person to beat hischallenge but it's not over yet thethree other fighters that weren't chosensuddenly come out of the shadows andhe's told he must take them all on atthe same time against three freshopponents he tries to put up a fight butthey take him down and brutally beat theman to death that's five down with threeto gookay this is the most deadly challengethey've had so far but the only way hewould have won is to cheat i gotta behonest here if i were in this situationthere's no way i could win this deathmatch because i'm not a fighter and evengoing up the stairs for me is exhaustinghaving said that if we can't overpowerthis beast of a man with her strengththen we're going to have to do it withour brains now something i wouldn't dois drink before the match becausealcohol is going to make you reactslower and have bad coronation duringthe fight instead of drinking shots withyour friends i would sneak the shotglasses into the arena and use them asprojectiles to throw at him doing thiswill cause him to flinch which helps meclose the distance and land blowswithout getting hurt now as a generalstrategy we do not want to get in thisguy's space this is one monster of a manwhich means he's slow but if he gets youin his area of attack he'll wrestle youto the ground and you won't be able tostop him the best way to prevent this isto limit your attacks to long distanceand quick movement because your onlyadvantage here is speed the objective isto get him tired and move yourselfaround him to find your best opportunityto strike instead of rushing straightinto his attack range now even if wetake this guy down that leaves us withthree new fighters and even for atrained martial artist you're not likelyto beat them which means we need to flipthis death match on its head as a lastteach effort you might be able to buyyourself time to recover by suggestingthat the audience would rather see aseries of one-on-one matches to maximizethe entertainment value and this willmake the show 10 times better by usingthe mastermind's desire to please hisaudience he might leave it to theviewers to decide and her chances ofsurvival will go up after the challengeis over casper here has a conversationwith the mastermind one-on-one hedecides to ask him what his motives arebehind this game and the man explainsthat he finds it disgusting how somepeople can become famous through no hardwork or talent and that he wants tocleanse the world of people just likethem that's when lonnie comes into theroom insisting they're not like that andwill prove him wrong the mastermind iscertain that the only reason they'reeven on the show is because they're allfame horse and wants success withoutearning it but he'll give them a chanceto prove him wrong leaving them for thenight the screen goes dark and the twoplayers decide to spend their last nighttogether with millions of viewerswatching there's not a single room thatdoesn't have a camera but in a gamewhere popularity and public opinionmeans everything it might have been thesmartest decision they've ever made thenext day the remaining three contestantsgather in the common room to await theresults with no idea this will be thelast time the panda announces that kathere has received the fewest votes thisround but she has one chance to redeemherself and her challenge will be tobeat the game's own mastermind fergusthe panda in a chess match meanwhile thefbi is hard at work on determining thelocation of the fun house and this copfigures out the show is taking place ingrady oklahoma a swat team is sent outto investigate the area and managed tofind a trapdoor with a panda face symbolon it just like the ones in the show asthey open up the hatch they're shockedto find the severed heads of thecontestants inside along with a bombthat's about to explode they weretricked and will never rescue theremaining victims in time at the realfun house kat here is about to start herchallenge where a chessboard has beenset up with oversized pieces the petaexplains that if he wins she'll have tospend the wheel of fun just like ooladid but her chances of winning are slimthe game begins and kat here isconfident that she can win this but themastermind is always two steps ahead ofher and she realizes she's met her matchthey've reached a checkmate and she hasno choice but to surrender her kingadmitting defeat as the mastermindgloats in his victory kat here loses thegame and is forced to spin the wheel offun but she lucks out it lands on thegold section meaning she's free to goand the challenge will be passed on tolonnie who must now step into the roomto take cat's punishment for her tryingto save her life casper volunteers totake her place in the challenge and themastermind accepts the deal but he hasone last trick up his sleeve that's whenhe reveals that the next challenge is tohave casper and lonnie dueled to deathbut if they refuse they'll cook hisgirlfriend alive inside a brazen bowland feed her body to him for dinner withno way out but to play they both take upa pistol and walk 10 paces away fromeach other turning around they pointtheir guns at each other but decide toend this game on their own terms insteadthey sacrifice themselves so they won'thave to kill each other and that's sevendown with none to gookay this is tragic but it was alsoentirely unnecessary casper heredemanded that he take the punishmentwith the assumption that he might die tosave her life but when it became a duelagainst each other they decided thatit's much better for two people to dierather than one these are seriously thedumbest people on earth because theystill had so many options available tothem and if casper here still wanted tobe a hero he could have simply given hislife in the duel to let her win now ifit were me and we were actuallyinterested in staying alive there aretwo alternatives that i would haveconsidered the first is to tell lanihere that we should both end our livesin protest but at the last second iwould chicken out and just not pull thetrigger when she dies i become thewinner and it makes this a really easyproblem to solve she would be dead andwe would be the winner by default nowthis would have one seriouslydevastating problem because even thoughwe would survive the duel there's stillanother voting round against kat hereand tricking her new girlfriend into thewrong end of her own gun is not going tobe a popular move to the voters thebetter solution is to actually considerwhat the rules were because the pandanever told them that one of the playershad to die it would have been perfectlylegal within the rules of the game toshoot the other players somewhere thatwas not fatal and the round couldtheoretically be over now the pandamight want to get vindictive and forceyou to keep shooting but i highly doubtit because these are single shotmuzzleloading pistols reloading one ofthese guns is incredibly time consumingwhich does not make for excitingtelevision nobody wants to sit there andwatch to reload hundred-year-old pistolsfor 30 minutes with this in mindhonoring the rules of the game byinjuring the other player withoutkilling them might be just enough topass the challenge and survive into thenext round kat here is the only survivorleft and she stares at the dead bodiesin shock as all the staff begin toapplaud her victory with seven playersdead she's finally won this death gameand the viewers just can't wait forseason two escaping with five milliondollars in a duffel bag the woman isfound by a passerby and rescued theauthorities are still in the hunt forthe mastermind behind the fun house andthe fbi holds her for questioning butshe has information to help

mean max verstappenparty flat out for me it's a track thati know very well because i won theformula four championship when i was 16or 17 years old long long time ago onthis trackit was at the time called formula bmwstanford also i have very bad memoriesbecause it was the biggest crash in mywhole career that i had there it was informula three i was coming down the mainstreet i think i was p3 trying toovertake p2 and um and we're 240 downthe main straight and at the end of thestraight there's quite a sharp turn andi got there in this battle and break inin breaking battle where this guy wassecond and i hit the brakes and usuallythe brake pedal is really solid i meanit's really firm you can hardly move ityou move it like one centimeter maximumor something i don't know and i hit thebrakes and the pedal the brake pedaljust went flop it just fell to theground there was zero resistance thefront brakes did work for some reasonthey worked the rear brakes didn't workin that moment so i think a stone musthave hit the brake umthe braking line on the rear uh and andbroken that and then i was going overthe gravel and i was seeing this wallcoming in front of me with just like twolayers of tires uh so that would havebeen a big big impact and i got scaredand i said okay i think i prefer goingin sideways because frontal you onlyhave these two thin seat belts that aregoing to hold you from flying forwardsand sideways you have the cockpit wallso my instinct told me just rip thesteering wheel around because it'sbetter to go in sideways where i canlike rugby tackle rugby tackle sidewaysthe cockpit wall and the and the thewall outside then um and then i gotlucky because i was flying over thegravel sideways and it's so easy to rollin that situation where then you couldgo head first into the tire barrier andit's the end the car was totallydissected and destroyed i was knockedout for like a couple of minutes nextthing i remember is the doctor who musthave come from the pit lane so he waslike miles away who was speaking to melike here if i'm okay so anyways uh nowstanford is a very challenging track soi'm going to take you through uh everysingle detail on a hot lap first andthen a slow lap but before we getstarted here's the question that you cananswer to get top trending comment onthis video and if you do get that i'llbe sending you a surprise gift so thequestion is who do i think is going toperform best in 2022 with the newregulations so good luck uh with youranswer if you get top training commenti'm going to send you a gift and now westart into the hot lapso that was the end of the hot lapuh good luck there in the end my goodpainful to get there so many mistakes somany spins[Music]um but that was a good one i mean it'scrazy track it's a fun track very hardto overtake though because so twisty andturn it's like a street circuit in theend um so now let's go into this load upand i'll explain everything to youokay so before we start here just aquick explanation because it's a new newtrack for everybody i mean no one's beenthere yet with an f1 car so how do youadapt and learn it in the best possibleway so first of allmost likely the f1 teams will have senta truck to that track and probably theysend it all together one track that doesa laser scan of the whole track and itcan therefore then give you the track indata uh in a laser laserthree-dimensional scan so every teamwill then take that data and then createa virtual track out of that and it willhave every single bump it will haveevery single curve so it's really reallyrealistic so all the drivers willcertainly have been driving this track alot in the simulatoruh just to really it's all about gettinga flow of the track the rhythm you knowthe details will never be able to beexactly right on the simulator but it'saboutunderstanding your breaking points moreor less so the 100 meter boards aregoing to bea realistic as well in the simulator asin the real track so you get a feel forokay as the 100 meter board passesthat's when i'm going to hit the brakesfor turn oneyou get the flow you get the lines howlate to turn in when is your apex allthese things that those are things youcan really get a head start on thesimulator so all the drivers will dothat but then still when you get to realtrack and especially as you're as you'regetting going you know you're alwaysstill gonna have to build up to findingthe limitso for example they're all gonna comedown on the main straight with 300kilometers an hour breaking into thefirst corner and there you just have toslowly build up to it you know so moreor less you know with an f1 car whereyour braking points are so here it'saround 75so you slam the brakes at 80 to beginwith and then you see how it goes so nowlet's come to the only overtakingopportunity on this track and it's turnone and so you're dressing there the guyin front is going to close the door soyou have to go around the outside thenyou just break so damn deep and you canalmost go because there's that bankingyou can go uh two alongside each otherthrough the corner uh also because theideal line is very wide on the entry sothere'll be a clean track on the outsidefor much of the entry so you can reallygo around the outside and then maybehang it out on the outside the problemis you've got to be really carefulbecause if the inside guy is still therehe can really run you off the track andinto the gravel so you have to be like awheel in front of him by the time youget the entry to the corner done andthen you'll have your your overtakingdone so maybe hopefully we'll see someexciting overtakes down to turn one it'spossible because with that banking it'smaking the straight really really longum going into the straight so maybewe'll see quite some overtakes not surehow much curb you can use on the exitthere uh we have to see how it is inreal life as use as much as you can stayleft left left left left and herethere's a lot of these corners that arelike that are like very long corners umbig radiuses you'll see later on on thetrack as well and they're hard becauseit's never good to brake very latebecause when you brake very late whilesteering um you're gonna be like understeering off locking the front tire soit's it's a track where you often haveto brake early and soft and also whenyou brake late what you do is you putthe car into a pitch so when you brakehard and late the front end dives downand you're putting the car in a pitchlike thatand that changes your aerodynamics alsoit will it will loosen up the rear endand that's why it's often faster in aformula one car to help keep the pitchas flat as possible so even though youlose a little bit of time because you'rebraking a little bit earlier and softeryou'll make up much more time than inthe middle of the corner because you'recoming into the corner with a much morestable situation you're keeping theaerodynamics in a constant situation soyou'll have much more grip than goingthrough the corner also you're notoverloading the front tires as muchbecause when you steer and brake hardyou're putting maximum load on the fronttires so the front tires will thenoverheat from entry onwards so you losefront grip so in these long cornersoften and it's very difficult becausedifficult to accept i break a little bitearlier softer to then be faster mid andexit it's very difficult to acceptsomething that i often struggle with inmy careerso here very soft braking release softlygo on the throttle softly so really softsteering inputs everything soft to keepthe car settled and then get the maximummid and exit umso carrying the speed here and it's thesame with downshifts you know no extradownshift keep uh keep sixth gear maybethrough here use all the track um sohere you use quite a lot of the trackmaybe not all the way to the exit thentry and come back and again you havethis bank corner here so you can breakagain quite soft you break in deep youlet the car roll in there then you gotthird gear in the middle of the cornerearly on power up shift early again longexit and then take the speed throughbecause it's quite a long straightsteering wheel as smoothly as possibledown here on this straightum[Music]then stay left stay left for this fastone here again brake softly late takethe speed in very late apex downshiftsixth gear you can use all the track onthe exit go a little bit right becausethen you need to dive in left to be leftleft left for again carrying as muchspeed through this one as possible whichis again six gear corner it's very veryfast almost flat maybe flat inqualifying and then here you're steeringquite a lot when you start braking soagain um you've got to brake a littlebit earlier and softly and just carrythe speed and otherwise if you brakelate also you just lock up the fronttire overload and you lose a lot of timeso here late entry carry the speed infourth gear probably third hug the apexlate and then use the whole track butimportant keep turning keep turningbecause you have to get back to theright for the next one so keep steeringtry and get back to the right as quicklyas possible fourth gear fifth gearfourth gear down here third gear againthis is a normal long radius corner usethe whole track on the exit careful it'svery easy to run onto the gravel thereokay accelerate back down hereand this is another corner where it's sodifficult to get used to when it's thefirst time on the track because it'slike a sequence of corners so yes youcan break really deep but then you'regoing to mess up the second part of thesequence completely so you've got to getused to this so usually you break around80 here you break really in a straightline and then heretake speed through but here it'simportant not to use all of the road andstay in the middle of the road becausethe next corner is the one where you canlose the most time or gain the most timeso you can see the tarmac the blacklines on the track that's where you needto be middle of the track here and thenagain carry speed here and try and makea little bit of a v-shaped trajectoryhere so you carry the speed in you stopthe car here then you turn and then youaccelerate out so you make a little bitof a v-shaped here umokay fourth gear fifth gear sixth gearand then this last corner is reallyreally fast and it's so hard to get itright by this time your tires areoverheating they're raging hot and it'sso important this corner because you'vegot a long straight afterwards so sixthgear you downshift one to fifth gear andhere um it's so difficult to hit theapex for some reasonyou break a little bit deep you justwon't get there to the apex you know andyou break early you lose too much timeso it'simportant because the curb on the insidei think is quite aggressive so you can'ttouch too much of itand you've got to get it just in theright spot and it will make a bigdifference in your grip if you get it inthe right spot for the cornering so sothat's a challenge and then again useall the track and then it's so hard herebecause right behind the curb there'sthe gravelso you'll see a lot of people runningout into that gravel there and damagingtheir floor as well because the curb isquite aggressive so this is reallydifficult exit because you can't affordto go on the gravel and stay on thatcurb use all the track then come backagain because there's gravel okay andthen this new corner here which they'vedone for f1 they've banked it and put anarmco right there it's like an oval it'slike a section of an oval umwhere it's easy flat and here it's justabout finding the place on the trackwhere there's the least bumps becauseless bumps you get more more speed umand also i mean of course inside ifpossible is gonna be the fastest way butreally depends where the track is bestuh and then just find that ideal linecarry the speed and uh and that's theend of the lapuh so thanks for watching that and nowwe're gonna jump into q aquestion one from alex hola what do youthink of what happened in spa was itright to give half points for onlyqualifying um well i don't know i meanfor the fans of course it was terribleso i hope they get next year's race forfree or something like that that wouldbe nicein terms of points i don't know i don'tknow if it's soi think it's fine i mean because it wasa formula one weekend everybody they dideverybody went to the limit inqualifying andand uhcanceling the whole weekend or givingthem points for what everybody achieveduntil then uh half pointsi think it's okay maybe a third of thepoints or something would have been alittle bit more appropriate since itreally was only qualifying um butnevertheless i think it was okay and maxverstappen deserved deserved to closethe championship lead with a phenomenaljob he did on the whole weekend and inqualifying so so it's okay um but ofcourse debatable yeah question two rbushka how did drivers prepare for acompletely new track that you haven'traced in sim hours so it's exactly as isaid simulator simulator and then also atrack walktrack walk you may be able to spot somekind of details about some curbs whichyou wouldn't spot in the simulator sothat can help as well question threebroker i would like to know if the fansat the track give you a lot ofmotivation as a formula one driver or ifyou ignore them no of course they giveyou motivation i mean max verstappengoing to uh the netherlands grand prixit's gonna be insane for him i mean thefans are gonna be out of control and andyou feel that but at the same time it'salsosometimes can be a bit more pressurebecause you just want that race wina little bit more than everywhere elsebecause it would be a little bit morespecial and so it can also add a littlebit of pressure so it really depends howevery driver handles that and but i'msure max verstappen i mean with pressurehe knows how to deal with that soit's going to be phenomenal to watch thesupport and on the contrary it's goingto be hard for lewis because lewis isgoing to be booed a lot certainlybecause of what's happened that's goingto be a tough environment for lewis torace inbut again i mean he's he's had thatbefore so he knows how to deal with thatand he remains concentrated so so but itwill be interesting to follow questionfour ingomar what do you think who isgoing to have an upper hand once newregulations come in so again this isyour chance to get top trending commentwith exactly this question so i want youto answer this question as well in thecomments and if you get top trainingi'll send you a gift so the questionagain was who's going to have the upperhand in 2022 from my point of view it'sgoing to be the usual top teamsmercedes red bull ferrari i think isgoing to be there butbut then maybe there can be somesurprises like alpine or mclaren or oruh or somewhere like aston martin sothat's uh that opens it up so that'sexciting um question five rafaelfrederick which camper setup and errorsetup will be most applicable fordanforth especially considering the banksetup at bank corners um it stand for itis quite fast in general on the averagespeed so you need quite a lot of camberespecially on the outside left on theright hand side not so much so you havedifferent cameras left to right um termsof aero settings i'm not sure becausethe straight is very very long so itwon't be maximum downforce but it willbe just one step below that i suppose umyeah so that's what they do and thenquite a quite a stiff car well itdepends i think average softness on thecar because yes you have quite fastaverage speeds but but at the same timeyou do have a lot of undulations sosofter car can help with that so therewe go so thanks again for watchingplease subscribe to my

x_qSdnjhbw4,Building an UNBREAKABLE TESSERACT CUBE!,1687124,81479,1474,"Of course, the main priority
is to make the box unbreakable.But I also want it to be unlike anything
we've seen before.And up we go.Let's see what we can design with this.Hey guys, I'm back!Still can't really use my hand, but it
is getting better. As you know, while I was away Just Dustin
brought us another unbreakable box.Well, even without me, my
team got in without any issue.But that got me thinking, why
don't we make him an unbreakable box?But not just any unbreakable box,
let's make him an unbreakable infinity tesseract cube.Now Henry, one of our engineering
co-op students this summeris going to do some material research
to build this unbreakable box.Let's hope he does a good job
because his grade depends on it.Where do we begin?We need a material that shatterproof,
so it can take more than one hit.We need to distribute the force
of impact across the surface area.So sharp points can't pierce it.And we need to be see-through so you
know exactly what you're missing.Well, acrylic shatters.So does glass.Whooo! Steel sure doesn't.But it's not see-through.This polycarbonate seems to work.Let's see how it stands
up to Hacksmith Industries.That's pretty crazy.Looks like polycarbonate's a go.It's actually what they use in addition
to acrylic and bullet resistant glass.Let's see what we can design with this.I built these two prototypes from
mirrored acrylic, but I don't love them.Of course the main priority
is to make the box unbreakable.But I also want it to be unlike
anything we've seen before.So I came up with this.Imagine a line.This line exists in one dimension.You have left.And right.If I take two of these lines,
connect them at both ends.I get a square.This square exists in two dimensions,
I have left and right, and up and down.If I connect two of these squares at their vertices,I get a cube.Now, imagine in the exact same way 
I connected two lines to get a square,and two squares to get a cube.I can connect two cubes to get
a four dimensional hypercubeOr a Tesseract.What you're seeing,
isn't actually 4D.It's just a 3D shadow of
a four-dimensional tesseract.Which you're actually
seeing in 2D on your screen.That's all really complicated.What I'm going to try to do is to
implement that in my unbreakable box design.Let's get back to Solidworks.I know the team's going to throw
everything at my tesseract.So I've designed inch thick
polycarbonate outside walls,inch thick walls for the inner cube and
quarter inch walls throughout.That's on top of a stainless steel sheet metal
frame, surrounding inch thick steel bars.Let's make it real.We're going to be using the laser
cutter to turn this sheet metal into the parts for inner and outer frames.There's a lot going on, but hopefully
once we've got it all cut out and bent,it'll make a little bit more sense.Now that the laser cutting's done, let's make some 90 degree bends.The vice mounted brake just can't fit these bigger bends.We're gonna use the box break.So I'm marking out the cuts for
the outside faces of my cube.Uh, they have these notched edges because
it's the only way I could figure out howto fit in the complex internal structure.So I have 12 more of these to go.Let's get goin.The outer piece is finished.Let's cut this down for the inside.As you can see, I have two half-inch
sheets of polycarbonate,which I've glued together with some acrylic cement.And the reason I did this is because
one-inch polycarbonate in the size I needis about $13,000 a sheet.So if I do it this way,
it costs a lot less.So what we're going to
be doing is cutting this lengthinto six identical faces, which we're going to beusing for the internal cube.Let's do that.Now that we've got the polycarbonate cut.Let's apply some mirror film.Well, that saved me three and a half hours!Well, now we've got to go and do a
little more cutting,so we can mount these to the frame,and then do a little welding for the inside cube.Everything's in multiples of
12 and four, six and eight.Yeah, so I'm going to be cutting
the inside LED channels, where the LED's sitand where the polycarbonate sits in between for structure.Alright. That's 24 LED channels, and 12 channel mounts.Alright, let's weld the center cube.The inner frame's welded with some LED mounts.Time to add the polycarbonateJust what I want to see.If you guys follow me on social media,
you might already know this, but Iactually struggle a lot with my mental health.Namely depression and anxiety.Building this business has taken a
pretty big toll on me personally.And I knew if I didn't change something,
I might not be able to do this forever.I had actually been planning
on taking some time offthis summer, to focus on myself.And I was actually getting really
excited about the prospect of it.And then I broke my hand.Suddenly, I had to take time off.Let's call it a forced vacation.Not being able to use my hand meant I wasn't able
to do what I love,which is making projects and testing them for you guys. And while a broken hand is temporary, mental health is forever.Taking care of our mental health is vital to
living a happy, fulfilling life.Thankfully, Better Help provides an

I'm changing how we do thingsto ensure Hacksmith Industries lives on for a long time.I'm excited to get back into
videos, but please be patient asI can't be in every single video.Now let's see how that box is going.You know, I've spent so much
time designing and building this box.But I really haven't put much
thought into what goes in it.Maybe we should ask some people.Let's find some unsuspecting workers.Tyler, Tyler, Tyler, what would you put in the box?Uhh, money.We're on the prowl.We've caught a wild Ian.Okay.We're making an unbreakable box and
we need to know what goes in the box.How do we one-up Just Dustin?Oh, oh, Ooh.Okay.How do we one-up Dustin?Well, we start by giving
his own money back to him.If he can break in...$1000.What else?I don't know. Well, we got Jess right here.And what, what do you think Jess?I really think that we should
put some snacks in the box.They might be hungry by
the time they open it up.I think like goldfish,
maybe like a fruit roll up.Yeah.Good idea.I agree with that.We got a good starting
point money and snacks.Could put, uh, some key chains in it, or
actually I have something better for you.We gotta take a walk though..Okay.In a hidden location.We got the Haskars, super rare.Only 10 ever made.Wow.
That's gorgeous.What is that damascus? That's damascus, or, sorry, beskar..Wow.
It looks beautiful.You wanna just drop it in?Here you guys go...got another thing.Let's keep it going.Chocolate chip cookies.And they do taste wonderful.I can say that firsthand.Buddy these are the best cookies money can buy.I love it.I think we got our snacks.We're sneaking up on him, it's like Bear Grylls.I got Darryl's phone with me.Okay.
We have a phone.Tyler, Tyler.I got right here.An unbreakable box currently
filled with chocolate chip cookies.Do you have any better
ideas to put in the box?Maybe in addition. Uh, let me take a look here.Yeah. I have just the thing.Seems prepared.Check that out.We can clone Bogdan with this.Alright put it in.There we go.It's the full Hacksmith
experience right there.I love it.Well, I can't lie.I might've eaten the cookies
on the way here, but there is something really interesting in here.Let's put the top.Let's weld the rest of the box.So the inner box is welded and it's not coming open.What I have to do now is add these
LED mounts to the outside, and thenrun this LED through the channel and
we're going to have a light up box.I'm going to glue this guy down.We're making progress here.It lights up.But as you can see, it stops right there.That's because I haven't
connected to it yet.So it actually creates its own wifi
network, which I can connect to andthen control the LEDs through that.Yeah that worked.Sometimes I like to make
life harder for myself *Laughs*See if this one blows up?Ooh, red light, blue light.No, no smoke.That's perfect.I covered the entire inner box
with addressable LEDs.So I can get these really cool effects.I'm running all the LEDs off of
one, three-cell battery,which doesn't actually last very long,
but for our purposes is alright.And basically, there's one power point at one side of the cube.Another powerpoint on the opposite points and that lets us power three different phases at a time.So all six faces, two power points.It all works out. To see the full schematic diagram click the maker.io link
in the description below.The inner cube is done.But as you can see, we still
got a lot of work to do.Let's get to it.Wait take it off.We got to do that again.There you go.That's good.Next we're putting in the posts.Four posts are in, now we gotta put in the sidewalls.Slide this in like that..Three more to go...yeah that's fine.Light work, light work.We are kind of nice at it.I realized the best next move is to weld the bottom 
of these bolts, to the actual support.The reason I'm doing that is
because otherwise it's justkind of going to rotate.And the bottom bolt is going to rotate with the nut when I try to tighten it, 
which doesn't work.So I could have done this earlier, but of course
I got to make my work a little harder for myself.Putting in the inner-angled walls now.I mirrored the outside walls to really
lean into that four dimensional aspect,really to make it look infinite.So now we've got the inner walls in.I've got to fit the top wall, but
it's going to be a little tough tomake it all fit with the ""U"" channels.It'll take a little love, but we'll get it done.Maybe we'll start with my corner.Okay. Yeah, that's in.All good here.Oooh...beautiful.Now that I've welded the one-inch frame, nobody's getting into this.Now all I got to do is add these corner pieces to tie together my design.You didn't think we'd send this off to Just Dustin without having a little fun first.This is the best part of my job.Thor's hammer from up top!That went right in the middle.This Morning Star's insane!Didn't do much!Alright your box seems pretty tough, but, uh, I think it's my turn.You nervous?What are you going to do to it?Ahhhh..Uh oh.*Laughs* it did a little dive!At this point we're just getting it dusty, nothing else.You know now it's kind of 
like a warn in sort of charm to it.You'd think he was tired!He never sleeps!Oh, he's definitely done some
damage, but I don't know.It's more dust than anything, cmon.That was pretty awesome.Yeah.It held up pretty damn good.We only managed to peel up the corner just slightly.I'm not surprised, like spot welds aren't
that strong, but it's still in one piece.This would look good in my living room, you know.Coffee table you know? Ottoman *Laughter*I don't think Dustin's getting into this.Nah.Did you see it like bouncing on it?Like I literally lifted the whole,
like that's a 10,000 pound machine.What?That's crazy.Okay. I think what we gotta do now is use the SkyJack to get iteven higher up than the Bobcat.And up we go.I did not know that it went that high.Alright. Ready?Ready?Okay, a bit far. I think I got it on the third one.I think I've tuned it in.Here we go.Yeahhh! That's what I'm talking about!Damn.That obliterated the concrete.The corners are getting a little beat up.We broke some of the spot
welds, which is to be expected,but the cube is still a cube.So let's get the TV out.There we go.Let's do it again.At this point I think if you saw the box on eBay it'd be ""slightly used"".Alright, here we go.Wooooaaahhh!!What am I watching the game on tonight?Yeah, the inner cubes inside. The whole internal structure is fine.It's just the actual mounts have fallen off, which to be expected.I didn't really glue them in place.Have you ever folded a TV before Henry?That's the newest Kindle.It's the biggest size they have.Alright I'm impressed Henry.A+ on your co-op term.Ah, thank you.I can't wait to see, uh, Just Dustin,
take his hand at this. But before we do that, let's give it to a gym.Let's see what some, uh, some
CrossFitters can do to this thing.Here we are at Templ Fitness in Kitchener, Ontario.Let's see what's some real athletes can do.Alright guys. Thanks for coming out.I built this unbreakable box and
I need your help to get into it.If you can. It's a thousand dollars and if you
can't, Hey, it's a good workout.*Applause*Start us off baby, start us off.I've got the powerrrr!Whoah!Yeah, come on!Sheesh!!Atta boy, come on!Yes! Woooo!Jeeeeez!!Good job buddy, Ilike that!Come on.It looks like it's coming loose.Oh, yeah.Get in there..get in there.C'mon! C'mon!Okay!Ohhhh! He cracked it!Wahoo!

s7MTM4BKZ_E,Why Anecdotes Trump Data,980055,36060,1347,"Some critics of the TV show Mythbusters claimthat the show misrepresents the scientific process.For example, experiments are sometimes conducted only onceand without adequate controls,but then these results aregeneralized to make definitive claimsrather than repeating the experimentand using statistical analysis as a scientist wouldto figure out what is really true.So, ironically a showthat is meant to educate people about sciencemay instead be giving them the opposite impressionof how science works.But you know, similar criticisms had been made of Veritasium.For example, when Destin and I performedour experiments to show that the water swirlsthe opposite way in the northern and southern hemispheres,we only showed doing it onceeven though we each did it three or four times in our own hemisphere.And I guess that brings forth the questionshould we change what we're doing --I mean should Mythbusters and Veritasiumreally show the repetitive nature of scienceand use statistical results as evidence for our claims.Well my answer is no, but to understand whywe first have to dig into something calledthe helping experiment.And this was performed in New Yorkin the 1960s. And the way it went was --individual participants were placed in isolated boothswhere they could speak to five other participants through an intercombut only one mic was live at a time.And these participants were meant to speak in turnsfor two minutes each about their lives --any problems they were having --and it would just go in rounds.Now what the participants didn't know was thatone of them was actually an actorwho was reading a scriptprepared for him by the experimenters.And he went first in the first round.He talked about the problems he was having adjusting to life in New York Cityand particularly the difficulty that he gets the seizures, particularly when stressed.And so everyone else had their turn and then it came back 'roundto this actor again. Now this timewhen he was speaking he became more and more incoherent as hewas talking. He said that he could feel a seizure coming on and he made choking noises,he asked for help from the other participants --he said he felt like he was dying --and, uh, then he continued to get more and more distresseduntil his mic went off.And the point of the experiment was to see how many of the participants would help.I mean, if you were one of the other participants, do you think you would've left your boothand gone to see if he was okay?In total, about 13 participants took part in this experiment --and the number that helped before his mic was turned off --was just four.Now, while this might sound a little bit disappointingabout the state of human helpfulness,you gotta keep in mind that there were other people listening to the same distress calland that may have diffused the responsibility that individuals would feel;this is something known as the ""bystander effect.""Now, what's interesting about this experiment from my point of viewis not how it confirms the bystander effect,but in how people view the results.For example, they fail to change their opinionof themselves or others after learning about this experiment.For example, have you changed your opinionabout how likely you would be to help in this situation --now that you know that only 30 percent of people did, in that situation?Well, there was a follow-up study conductedwhere students were shown two videosof individual participants who were purported to be from the original study.And they had already learned about the study,and then they were asked at the end of watching those two videos --which were pretty uninformative, just showed that these people weregood, decent, ordinary people --these students were asked,""How likely do you think it wasthat those two particular participants helped?""And overwhelmingly students feltthat those two participants would have helped --even though they knew that, statistically, only 30 percent did, so,in fact, if would've been a better guess to say that they probably didn't.They didn't seem to really internalizethose general results as pertaining to the particular,they kind of assumed it excludedordinary, good, decent people.Now, is there a way to get people to reallyunderstand how the world works?Well, they did another follow-up studywhere they talked about the experiment,they described the experiment,but they didn't give the results.And then they showed those two participant videos --again, not mentioning anything about the experiment,just showing that these are two, decent, ordinary peopleand then they told the students that those two peopledid not help in the experiment.And they asked the students to, uh, guesswhat proportion of people did help.And now, in this case, when they were goingfrom those particular examples of ordinary, nice peoplewho didn't help,they were much better at generalizingto the overall result,to the statistical result.In fact, they got it basically right.And I think this highlights for us thatour brains are much better atworking with individual storiesand things in detailthan they are with statistical results.And that is why I thinkif you're Mythbusters or Veritasiumit's better to communicate science --to tell the story,to show the experiment, really, once in a dramatic way --rather than three or four timeswhere each new iteration --well, each repetition --just confirms the original result that you were talking about.But if you're actually doing the science.If you're actually trying to establish scientific fact --then of courseyou need the repetition and the statistical analysis.So I think it really does come down to what your objectives are.But with this conclusionI think this opens uptwo big potential pitfalls.One is that people without scientific evidencecan make crafty storiesthat catch onand quickly become what people feel is the truth.And the other pitfall is scientistsWho have strong scientific evidence --Who have clear statistical results --and yet they can't communicate them to peoplebecause they don't have a great story.So, an example of the first pitfallis the recent spread of this rumorThat the outbreak of a birth defect microsephalyin South America was actually causedby a larvicide made by Monsanto.That story caught on like wildfire.And you can see why because its got this clear villain --that everyone loves to hate -- in Monsanto.And its got a really causal storyThat someone is doing something badto the water -- and its this poisonthat were poisoning ourselves andits a very emotive -- clear -- story.While the other story is, uh,Well it's a little bit more statistical -- that there issome kind of connection -- which is the scientific consensusThat the Zika virus carried bythese, uh, mosquitoesis causing the microsephaly.And there are strong indications that that really is what's happening.And if you look at the claims about the larvicide,they really don't hold much weight.I mean, the larvicide is so weak,that you could drink a thousand litres of it a day.A thousand litres of the water treated with this larvicide and have no adverse effects.Or, uh, this larvicide has been used in dog and cat pet collars.Um, so really, you know, there isn't strong evidence for the larvicide connection. In factThere is no connection between the larvicide and Monsanto at all.But I think the story took hold because it had such a strong narrativeOn the other hand, you have things like climate change,which have very strong statistical evidence to back them up,large scale result over the globe.And yet, one cold snowy winter is so much more, uh,visceral and meaningful to individual peoplethan this thing which feels, you know,completely databased.And, it just depends on how much you trust data, I guess.As scientists, we love data.And we feel like, if we're trying to communicate to someone,we're trying to convince someone of something,all we have to do is show more data.But what experiments demonstrate to us with statistical certaintyis that stories work much better.Normally I do this walk and talk self videos on my second channel, 2Veritasium, butI imagine that some of you might not know that that exists.So, I thought I'd put one of these here on 1Veritasium.Plus, this one has a fair amount of data and, you know, experimental stuff in it,so I figured that could be interesting for you as well.So if you want to check out the check...[CHUCKLES]So if you want to check out the second channel, thengo to 2Veritasium. I'll put a card or something for it up here.",0

shoulders and hit him withthe kneeright on his face was the best knee icould possibly give him somebodyand expect him to justi expect to win the fighting right thatin that momentbut he just shook he he stood up liftedhis head shookhe spilled a toothand stuck back ready again to goyou know i and then i felt like wasreally serious and the thing was muchserious than i expectedand for the next 10 minutes because was10 minutes roundsfor the for the end of the roundwe just engage and fall on the ring andcome back in and back in out anda lot of a lot of commotion a lot ofstrengthand in the end of the round i kind ofcrawled into the cornerand i said to my dad dad i quit i know icannot go anymore i'm tiredand my dad not even listened to me saidyeah he's tired and you he's worse nowhe's gonna kick his ass do this and thatsaid dad i'm serious man i'm deadi cannot goand then my brother holds throw me abucket of ice and water in my head i goand then bang the route the bell ringsand i push in againand like my dad saidi could beat the guy in three minutesbecause he was already tired wastedshoes so when i grabbed his back hecould not escape and i put him to sleepand uhand then i confirmedmy worst enemy was in my mindwas themy enemy wasin my brain tell me i have to quit ihave to so i decideand that daynever hurt my my mind tellbad things to me anymoreso either i'm gonna dieor i don't go but if i go i cannot sayoh i think i had enough i think it'stime to so this was the worst enemy icould haveand from that day on i decide to eithergo to putting every tank on it or don'tgo at allso it was easier for me because i wouldstart toto to deal withone enemy only not two enemies my mindand my opponentit's probably the most common thing thathappens to fighters is they they losefaith in themselves or they they startto look for a way out yesthat's pretty much uhbecause you don't see the other side yousee yourself and you see you tired yousee with problems you start to see thenegative aspects of youand you're notputting yourself like the guy has thesame problems he has the same ideas soyou have to keep going here aseverything is normaland it's hard toto people relate to that you know whenyou start getting the problems you startto see yourself bigger than the otherones you know more problems and moreand that's not going to be the the rightway to resolve the matter it'sinteresting that you figured out how tohandle these thingson your own too because this is uhit's an area that fighters seekpsychological help with now they hirepsychologists and they they gethypnotized and they do all thesedifferent things to try to figure outhow to stop that negative conversationin the mind how to stop those negativevoices and how to not give in to thatweakness that
